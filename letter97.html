<P>Dear Friends:</P>

<P>While on our Christmas visit last year to Florida to visit Sue's Mom
and Dad, we went manatee-watching. We rented a cute little electric battery
powered mini-houseboat, and went humming along in manatee hangouts looking
for blubbery moms and pups. Saw quite a few too, and truly it was pretty
exciting in a slow sort of way. But we had gone out on a two hour rental
in a boat with 45 minutes of battery power. Keegan and Dad watched the
little electric motor's propeller ever-so-slowly turn as the last few molecules
of lead turned to lead oxide, and wondering if the propeller had any effect
at all. We finally threw a line to a passing charter manatee-watch boat
and became the spectacle of their trip. Never any danger, but most thought
I was tapping out SOS in morse code on the boat horn. Close, but the last
character was dah-di-di-dit.! Another Christmas letter was off to an ominous
auspicious start....</P>

<P>Then on December 31 of last year came, from Keegan, the question. THE
question, first heard, &quot;Dad, can I borrow the keys to the car?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot; Subsequent tries have been more successful.</P>

<P>Nothing happened in January. Truthfully, we celebrate Sue's birthday
(39 forever, like Benjamin Kabelsky) on the first of the month, but have
to celebrate the night before since nothing but football happens on New
Years. Every second, you no doubt remember, the Earth is struck by four
and a half pounds of sunlight. But not much lands in Indiana in January.</P>

<P>During February, the Angermeiers came to visit. Have to explain... In
the summer of '96, Keegan and best friend Brian Lerg went to a summer study
course at Ball State in Muncie, &quot;Analog and Digital Electronics.&quot;
The class also featured a girl, Holly, from far-away Mount Vernon, Indiana.
She made friends with Brian and Keegan; our hunch is because both the boys
are so handsome and all three are tall. Well, Keegan, recognizing a good
thing when he sees it (thankfully!) followed with Holly, and vice versa.
Her whole family came to visit in February and brightened the month considerably.
Shopping at Circle Center, our new downtown mall was in order, then the
group split to do a 3-D movie, or fly. Holly's brother showed great capability
in his ability to fly a plane.</P>

<P>At the end of the month, a new near-family member came to join Orville,
our beloved fat cat. Newly arrived was Dudley, an orphan from a previous
small family who threw him out to join a fad. Dudley fills the bill as
travel agent, facilitator, and knock-about friend. Dudley's great, fun
but cheap-to-keep, takes a lot of abuse and doesn't eat much. But Dudley
represents the possible end of the Volvo dynasty. Dudley's a little car.
And he stays pretty busy. So much for winter, let's get on with Spring.</P>

<P>And spring did arrive right on schedule, March 20 at 8:55 AM. We brought
in the month with great anticipation, as usual. No lie - Sue burned out
the bearings in her exercycle getting ready for the oncoming pedaling season.
Dudley made his first trip to Mount Vernon. It's tough sending your son
out on a four hour drive, with a new driver's license, to visit a girl.
&quot;Be sure to stop if you get tired. (right!) Don't forget to turn left
at Illinois. The speedometer reads 3.6% high. BE CAREFUL!&quot; March also
brought a TV spot for Phil and Sue. Phil, it seems, had bid on a Christmas
tree at a benefit, largely because in its boughs were tickets to the Indy
500. It was won, and also contained about six cheap stopwatches and tickets
to dinner with Reid Duffy. Reid is the restaurant reviewer for our local
start-up channel that we've never watched. Dinner, with cameras rolling,
was at a wonderful Afganistani hangout, Kabul. Reid is a very neat eater
with tape running, rather a slob otherwise! Had fun, but we missed the
broadcast.</P>

<P>April's Spring Vacation brought a ski trip to Park City, Utah for Lauren
and Keegan and Sue and ski friend Therese, where they joined Sue's sister
and family. April 17 brought flowers, for Keegan! The occasion was the
prom, two proms! Keegan's was on Friday, Holly's the following night. The
Comanche proved its worth in flying Holly back to Zionsville after her
school day. The &quot;kids&quot; were off for a fun evening of Crazy Love,
the theme. Keegan had a Chemistry scholarship exam the next morning, then
the two and Dudley were off to Mount Vernon again. More dancing to the
theme of Midnight Masquerade, then a decent night's sleep. Wonder if they'll
be back-to-back again this year. Oh, and Charlie, the Black Lab next door,
flunked puppy school.</P>

<P>May brought a big gulp. Lauren's diabetes (she's doing very well, all
in control and all the family eating good diets as a result) has led to
great activity with the American Diabetes Association. Their big fund raiser
is a local bike ride, and Phil was interviewed on a local TV show, &quot;Kristianna&quot;,
live, and blind to the questions being flung at him. Gulp. And May brought
a very wet spring, with Keegan and Phil going twice to the 500 track to
watch the race, and getting in only 13 laps before the skies opened. Just
as well perhaps, with turbochargers eliminated from racecars now that they
are common in family sedans, the noise level of the race cars has gotten
unbearable (Phil measured 119 dB). The 500 just isn't what it used to be,
sadly. The race ran on Monday, with Keegan at school and Phil at work.</P>

<P>Our local tourist airline with an old jet took us to Gander for fuel
(we had driven there a few years before), to Shannon for fuel (ditto),
then finally to Zurich for Sue and Phil's chance to show the kids that
the norms we know in America are not the norms world-wide. We rented a
nice Nissan Quest, and set off for Crans-Montana, Zionsville's sister-city
in the Alps in Switzerland. Lots of pictures and a pleasant visit, then
off to Zermatt to climb the Matterhorn. We did, though admittedly not to
the top (perhaps 10% of the way), and truly enjoyed the mountain hiking
trails and photo ops with an elderly restaurateur and her cats. Took the
opportunity also to ride the cog railway to a little visited glacier stop,
and had a strong reminder of how huge and how varied our wonderful world
is. On to the castles of Germany, then a visit with a pen pal of Phil's.
Stephanie Kuemmeth and family live in a small rural town in Bavaria, Ludenhausen.
It's the house with the fire siren on the roof, since it's the highest
spot in town. The Kuemmeths, with their rich and varied activities, put
most to shame! They keep in their former farm yard an incredible zoo of
turtles. They had turtles from the desert, turtles from the marsh, turtles
from the mountains, all in separate outdoor habitats carefully managed
and groomed. They had records on every egg laid, every hatchling, and a
host of homemade equipment to support the hobby. They were also into raising
bees, had several large hives going with attendant buildings to observe,
culture, and keep the equipment, again often homemade. Dad (Sepp) was a
rock gardener (and biology professor) who had a wonderful rugged display
of his art, and mom (Lore) had extraordinary talents in music and the care
and hatching of turtles. Brothers were also into electronics, specializing
in stroboscopes, with extraordinary interest in aviation, and Ferdinand
had just won the Bavarian Youth music competition which he took with his
harp playing, and deserved, so beautiful! Absolutely unbelievable family,
so accomplished, so interested, so unassuming. No television. I wish we
had space to tell you about their neat house and barn.... </P>

<P>On to the rest of Germany, with stops in Italy, Austria, Liechtenstein,
and France. Most intriguing for Phil and Sue was to see East Berlin again,
without The Wall, and how radically the city had changed since the previous
visit. It was as if the sun had come out. Bombed out buildings had been
repaired, the food had become edible, the cars actually ran, and, most
significantly, the people smiled. The people smiled. I can't tell you how
much a change that represented. The trip affirmed again the values that
we so often miss, freedom, competition, sufficient food and hard goods.
Everyone sees different things when they travel to strange places. For
us, we see that our way is not the only way, and we see how lucky we are.
America is not perfect; there's plenty of room for improvement. But the
principles and values upon which it is founded, especially since they were
developed more than 200 years ago, are so blindingly simple and well thought
out as to astound one with perfection. The challenge is to live them.</P>

<P>A quick pass through our ever-popular laundry room, then a quick repack
was in order for Keegan and Sue who rode the TRIRI in June, Touring (bicycle)
Ride In Rural Indiana, 419.11 miles of hilly southern Indiana countryside.
At the same time, Lauren was off to the mountains of Colorado on a school
related trip, hiking and taking pictures. Busy month!</P>

<P>July brought a visitor, Sasha Tsourikova from Moscow. Sasha's arrival
was through the auspices of Sam Wentworth, a true saint that poses as an
endocrinologist in Danville, Indiana. Sam arranges for a dozen Russian
diabetic kids to come to America every summer. Here they learn our more
intensive management of their disease, which is treated more lightly there.
Sasha stayed with us for three weeks and did the daily summertime routines
with us, flying, a heavy dose of roller coasters, and bicycle training
led by Keegan. At the end of her Zionsville stay, Lauren and Sasha were
off with all of the Russian kids and host American teens, to a 2 week bicycle
ride over most of Michigan and Wisconsin. They rolled up 550 miles by bicycle
and two ferry rides in their exposure to our country. We sent Sasha back,
as we had with Anastasia the year before, with a photo album of her stay
and an invite back. And should we ever make it to Moscow, we have places
to call home also.</P>

<P>July took Keegan off to Indiana State University for another summer
course, this one on Physics. Yes, Holly was there too, and the time together
must have been spent well as the relationship has grown.</P>

<P>August, winding down of summer, time to slow down. Aunt Lissa (Phil's
only sib) came with 5 year old daughter Molly for a visit. School started
again for Lauren and Keegan, her high school freshman year, his senior.
And for Phil again too, with continuing logistics courses to better learn
the specifics of his engineering trade. The potential, Phil says, is wonderful,
the practice he finds himself in duller than yesterday's dishwater. George,
Sue's dad, also came, as did a significant drought to make up for the spring
rains. And the Comanche's engine flunked it's annual inspection, was removed,
and Phil and Keegan drove it off to Tennessee for overhaul. It had only
been 37 years since last done. (We expect to have that project finished,
finally, by Christmas.) And Phil pulled from the back burner a project
begun before the kids arrived, a replica of the first Heathkit, a one-place
airplane. Two wings are now finished, and Phil is boning up on his welding
in preparation for the fuselage work. And the kids were off to Zionsville
High again, Lauren a freshman, Keegan a senior! It was their first time
in the same school since pre-school and kindergarten.</P>

<P>September brought the college applications for Keegan. He applied to
Purdue's Engineering School, that had been his first choice college since
he was a little kid. He mailed his application on September 16. He was
accepted September 18! September 19th brought Phil's 30th high school reunion
in Port Chester, with Sue accompanying. Phil, playing on his people-finding
skills, was the class''s &quot;lost classmate finder&quot;, and didn't
do too badly with some of the beautiful Italian names that were his classmates.
Nor the Spanish names, Polish names, French names; gosh, he missed all
over again the cultural diversity that is scarce in Indiana. Dudley made
his first trip to &quot;The City&quot; and fared well on NYC's worn streets.</P>

<P>October brought another stock market crash, and it was the news at home
that night until Keegan opened his mail. He got an 800 on the SAT Math,
1500 combined. 800 is perfect, and the combined put him in the top little
-ith percentile overall. WOW! With that and his strong, all-honors near
perfect grade average, he's taken shots at MIT and Cal Tech. And he was
also accepted at Rose Hulman, an excellent small private engineering school
in western Indiana. Rose is his ace-in-the-hole and would be wonderful,
and they've given him a nice scholarship. We'll see how the others go.
If grades and College Board scores and outside activities count, he has
an honest chance at some of the biggies. Phil was off to New York on Halloween
for some surprise trick-or-treating with long time friends, and his fourth
year to run the New York City Marathon as a runner's guide for a handicapped
runner - member of Achille's Track Club. As usual, the experience was tough
and very very rewarding. Those readers that think they couldn't possibly
run a marathon should see the determination of some of the Achilles heroes
that do. These people have both determination and self-confidence (that
brings tears to my eyes as I write this sentence) that enable them to do
what able people feel impossible. It's tough, incredibly tough for some,
but the hugs at the finish line and the knowledge that they've done it
makes it all worth while. All of you, each and every one of my readers,
should begin a walking program with the intent of doing a half-marathon
the first year, a full marathon the second. It's there, believe me, and
you'll amaze yourself as you find it.</P>

<P>Where are we? November. Back to New York, this time for the entire family
to see the parade. We always get together with Phil and Lissa's family
and with long-time, dearest friend Trudi, usually in Kansas or Indiana.
Three years ago we decided that this year would be in New York, Trudi the
host. This year came. What of Trudi's shy cats, will they survive the onslaught?
Will Trudi? Scott ended up not going, his Dad was sick. Melissa and Molly
endured bad-weather flights to La Guardia instead of the intended Westchester
County, but made it to Port Chester and Trudi's house just fine the weekend
before. She and Molly had a wonderfully busy week visiting and re-familiarizing;
it had been many years for Lissa. Phil and family arrived by station wagon
(the driving is easy now that Keegan can take a shift) on Wednesday late,
and all were off on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (now
Metro East) to the City for the New York City - Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade. The 8th tier of watchers at the corner of Central Park West and
64th Street were the perch for the Browns, Molly and Lissa found places
on the cold, pointy top Central Park stone wall. The wind was whipping
down the side streets and making confetti tornadoes on the avenues, cool.
Here's the New York Times account, in part, on the demise of Barney, the
loveable children's dinosaur: &quot;The crash of Barney, the purple dinosaur
beloved by preschoolers and loathed by some parents, was heart-stopping
for those on the end of its ropes. &quot;Everything turned purple&quot;
said Antonella Laggiano of Mamaroneck, N.Y. &quot;Barney attacked us.&quot;
After it fell, police officers rushed to puncture it with knives and relieve
the danger.&quot;</P>

<P>Thanksgiving dinner was at an old private club in Rye, Coveleigh, and
a wonderful choice of Trudi's to take us there. Friday was a huge get-together
of the kids of our generation, and their kids, and their parents. Amazing
that, no matter how much water passes under the bridge, we remain pretty
much the same.</P>

<P>December. Who let December in the door? As this is written, we are preparing
for our third snow, this one a full time Winter Weather Warning. Kids prepare
for tests, dad for a final exam, and Sue for the holidays. And this letter
is going together before the twenties of December! We're in pretty good
shape, as they say.</P>

<P>We're in pretty good shape. That's to a great degree true because of
the wonderful friends we've picked up over the years, or been born related
to! Those friendships have been most significant to our lives, and Phil
and Sue hope that their kids derive as much pleasure and satisfaction from
friendships, new and old, as we have. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays to
each of you, for you've been important to each of us. God Bless.</P>
