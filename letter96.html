Dear Friends:<P>
	1996 started with a surprise for the kids, a wonderful "gift" backfired.  It seems that it snowed heavily on December 19, `95, and they got off school the next day, and the next day, a half day because it marked the beginning of the Christmas break.  But, they must make up the days, and worse, the half day missed had to be made up in 1996 with a full day of class.  Aw....<P>
	January brought one of Phil's pilgrimages to The Big Apple.  The excuse was a Disney stockholders meeting, but friends and the city were visited.  Remember the Blizzard of `96 ?  Phil was there, digging out with the locals.  The month continued bitter cold, but Keegan managed to log 102 bicycle miles.<P>
	February started still cold, 12 below.  It was less fun again for Dad on a particularly warm Saturday, February 10th.  Keegan and Phil went for an early season bicycle ride, into a strong wind.  Keegan, well, Keegan dusted his dad who couldn't possibly pedal hard enough to keep up.  First time for that, certainly not the last.<P>
	Sunday March 17th, after church, Phil made green pancakes, and Sue's dinner was tinged with green, as were Lauren's cupcakes.  And finally, it's warm out again.  Spring!!  Not so for Keegan and Sue, they were off to Park City, Utah for a week of skiing and relaxing.  They skied through near blizzards, smiling.<P>
	As I write this paragraph, on April 30th, it is raining cats and dogs in the front yard, and it's sunny and nice in the back yard, honest!  Lauren spent her April Spring break at Big Pine Key in Florida, at Seacamp.  Her science teacher, Sue Seminick (a pearl herself) took 36 middle school kids to study marine biology.  They'd snorkel, collect specimens, then discuss the marine ecosystem.  Lauren loves science!<P>
	If I were writing May with my usual fountain pen, the writing for May would be smeared.  It rained, rained, and rained some more.  While the short bursts of sunshine between the storms and rainy days caused the lawn and trees to do their spring thing, it is hard to mow without losing the mower in the mud.  Awards rained in May too as Keegan brought home a copy of the CRC Tables for Chemistry and Physics, a huge volume of rocket science type stuff for placing so well in an American Chemical Society scholarship exam.  He and best friend Brian were each awarded the ZCHS's medal for Chemistry.<P>
	June brought  new old job for Phil.  Finally, and with much thanks, Phil rejoined his old employer, the Naval Air Center, hoping to transfer to Hughes Aircraft when the facility "privatizes" early in 1997.  No longer Occupational Safety Manager, Phil's now in Logistics, managing the distribution and support of a couple of naval aircraft communication radios.  None of the interesting problems of safety, but it's direct funding, that is it's paid for directly by the Navy and pretty likely to be continued after the big transition of the business to Hughes.  Lump in throat, here we go.  And having no time on the job accumulated, Phil misses out on the family vacation, a neat train ride from Winnepeg via the Trans Canadian Railroad to Jasper and Vancouver.  Lauren, Keegan and Sue enjoyed bicycling in the mountains (always more fun downhill), rollerblading in Stanley Park, Vancouver,  and a wonderful bed & breakfast called Mountainside Manor with a great view of the mountains and city, great garden, great food, and wonderful proprietors.  The trip back included a side trip to Churchill on Hudson's Bay.  Twelve hour turnaround on the arrival home, and Keegan was off to a month long "Analog and Digital Electronics" class at Ball State University as a National Science Foundation Young Scholar.  Dad, stuck in his electronics world with tubes and grid leaks, was jealous of Keegan's knowledge of nand, nor, xor, and xand gates, microprocessors, and the beginnings of Boolean algebra.  They also met lots of other students, not the least of which was Holly from Mount Vernon, Indiana.  There have since been a few trips back and forth.<P>
	July brought an unusual visitor, Anastasia Kuskova from Moscow.  "Stacy", as she preferred, was one of a group of diabetic kids visiting from Russia to see American culture and to learn our methods of intensive control.  Stacy particularly loved our American supermarkets, and the "American hills" (as they're called in Russia), roller coasters.  We included Cincinnati's The Beast in her travels here, probably the world's most wonderful wooden roller coaster.  She was delighted also with our ice cream and big houses during her three week stay. She and Lauren were off to Happy Hollow Camp together.<P>
	Aunt Melissa and niece Molly also did a little traveling in August, up from Coffeyville, Kansas.  They helped to get Lauren back from Happy Hollow and off to a Fast Forward program at Rose Hulman Technical Institute.  Seventh and eighth grade girls were introduced to the world of college science and engineering.  She built a solar powered car, and came away with an appreciation of college life.  Life for the kids came to an end on August 21st, back to school, Keegan a junior and Lauren in 8th grade (though she's taking Honors Freshman Algebra and 2nd year high school French.<P>
	September again brought The Smoothest Ride, an American Diabetes ride on the Indy 500 track where the Browns do a fair share of the registration and radio communication work.  One of Phil's unusual organizations, the Society for Industrial Archaeology, met in Columbus, Ohio for a tour of that city's industrial relics.  Most fascinating were Union Fork and Hoe, making garden tools the same way since the Twenties, Barry Bolt doing their manufacture of unusual bolts since the 1880's (both in their original buildings with original equipment), and visits to some of the remnants of the canals that once laced the Midwest.  And Keegan got to contribute to the country's statistical base as the US Census polled him for how the younger half lives.  "Do you like to set fires?" and "Do you wish you were a person of the opposite sex?" were among the question set.  The envelope was sealed with official government red tape and mailed off to DC somewhere.  Also in September Keegan was inducted into the National Honor Society and Phil began a series of Purdue courses in his new occupation, Logistics.  September also found Keegan at his first job, Student Shelving Clerk at the Zionsville Public Library.  Juvenile Division, the shelves are a little short for his 6'2" frame, but he manages.<P>
	October brought the usual but lovely Hoosier metachromatism and an unfortunate digital burp.  Phil's little digital address and memo book came up saying "Memory error.  Push Y to reset."  I never found another option, and all of my Christmas card records and friends addresses were gone.  The family did another Hilly Hundred bicycle tour, L&S catching up with K&P at each rest stop!  It was Lauren's third year, but the first completion of both days and all 100 miles.  You gotta come to Indiana and do this event with us, it's wonderful!<P>
	November?  Phil's third New York City Marathon, this time with Achilles wheelchair runner runner Maximo Rodriguez from the Bronx.  7:23:42 if you're keeping stats, but more importantly a lovely sunny day and lots of sightseeing, and old and a few new friends.  November also included a trip for Phil and Lauren and Keegan and Brian to Santa Claus, Indiana (no kidding) to watch the Zionsville Eagles defeat the Heritage Hills Patriots for the semi-state football championship.  20-19 in overtime, Zionsville pulled off the victory with a two point conversion and in moments seemingly all of Zionsville's residents were on the field.  I write this on Thanksgiving evening, we're all preparing to be at the final game in the Hoosier Dome on Saturday at noon to watch Zionsville take on the Fort Wayne Bishop Dwenger Saints.  Orville just drank the last of Trudi's scotch & water.  Lissa and Scott and Molly were here from Coffeyville again, and Trudi flew in from Port Chester.  Turkey & Trivial Pursuit are now behind us.  Oh, WE WON, 14-7!  Class 3A State Champions!<P>
	Keegan and Dad did a little catch-up with the Indiana Courthouses photo album in December.  The two had happened to photograph one another while on flying-off-to-somewhere-for-lunch trips to prove they had been there, and the courthouse photos had become a "thing".  There are 92 counties in Indiana, each with a county courthouse, most built in the 1880-1920 time frame, most stately and beautiful.  Well, we had pictures of one or the other of us in front of two courthouses, what of the other 90?  Over the course of the year we managed to "hit", as we call it, 24 courthouses and December brought the dedicated photo book and map up to date.  Our courthouse tour has served as a great excuse to spend time and travel together, to seek out little restaurants, and to plan.  It's fun!  We have to wonder how many counties and parishes and whatnot there are in the entire country.  Anybody have a list?  What a summer trip that would be!  Soon, you'll be able to visit our homepage, http:\\www.iquest.net\~browns<P>

	Christmas is a wonderful season, for us it affords the opportunity to do the family photo (this year in our dining room, write a this brief summary, and just do our keeping in touch.  Time also to remember why we celebrate this season, sing carols and offer prayers and thanks, and to remember how lucky we are to have so many friends.  God bless all of you.<P>
		Love,   Phil, Sue, Keegan & Lauren (and Orville too!)<P>
