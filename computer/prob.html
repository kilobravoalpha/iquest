<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers have given us incredible powers, which is
why they are so useful to us. They constantly evolve to become better,
faster, and smarter machines, and it becomes a struggle for us to keep
up with the pace of technology. Without access to a computer, we have no
chance of keeping up with the blistering pace of digital evolution. Computer
skills are so crucial in today's workplace, and such skills can often mean
the difference between finding work and finding only dead ends. Those who
are poor and have no access to computers are then faced with a problem,
one needs money to gain access and one needs access to gain money.</P>
