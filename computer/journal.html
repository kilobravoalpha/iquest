<P>#1. Why did you choose your topic?</P>

<P>For me, deciding on my topic was an easy choice. From the very beginning
I have had the idea that I wanted to do a topic involving the dispute between
technology and mankind. I thought it would be an interesting topic for
me to research. I did have some problems in coming up with an overarching
question that would be solvable and unbiased, but I was able to write an
appropriate one. I also thought that by choosing to investigate problems
with technology, I could provide a ne perspective on a situation that most
people do not see as a problem.</P>

<P>#2. What relationship does your topic have with your life after high
school?</P>

<P>One of the major reasons that I chose my topic was because of what I
want to do after high school. I plan to become an electrical or computer
engineer, which deals with a high level of technology. The question of
whether technology could hurt mankind is extremely relevant, as it will
relate to my future profession. When I make choices in my future job, I
want to know if they could possibly harm mankind. The relationship with
my topic and my choice of careers should should also make it easy to conduct
a mentorship in the field of electrical or computer engineering.</P>

<P>#3. Tell about an experience you've had where your topic is concerned.</P>

<P>In many of the activities I do, I find computers to be a great help.
It is certainly much easier to type a report on a word processor than on
a typewriter. A computer can do a lot for you, but for this reason it can
also do you a lot of harm. I have noticed that the spell checker has actually
made it harder for me to spell words. There seems to be no reason to learn
to spell a word if the computer can spell it for me. Calculators can also
make it harder for you to do math on your own by doing it for you. By making
my life easier, computers may have been allowing me to forget the skills
I need.</P>

<P>#4. What is your personal definition of the important terms in your
overarching question?</P>

<P>Overarching Question: How might we, as a society, utilize computer technology
to our advantage?</P>

<P>In order to create a true overarching question, the writer must understand
exactly what it means. In order to do this, it is extremely helpful to
define the terms used in the statement. In science, this is called making
operational definitions, which is also crucial to your paper. When I say
society, I mean everyone. The problems plaguing our computer technologies
affect everyone, regardless of age, sex, or race. While there may be a
bias based on the socioeconomic level because people with more money will
have more access to computers, computers still touch everyone's lives.
We must all work together to find an appropriate solution. Computer technology,
for the purposes of this paper, will refer to everything digital. This
includes computers, calculators, CD players, ATMs... Anything that can
think digitally. In its simplest sense, digital technologies include appliances
like digital clocks and remote controls. Computers are no longer limited
to desktop boxes, they can now be found everywhere. A new car may contain
dozens of interconnected computers all serving different tasks. Computer
technology is a broad term that takes on a variety of meanings. Using the
technology to our advantage means that we will solve any problems that
may arise that threaten our society. As our technology advances, it becomes
hard to see what the future has in store. Will computers make human interaction
obsolete? Will machines ever do our jobs for us? We need to be sure that
the answers to these questions won't make us white with fear. If we don't
use the technology to our advantage, it may simply take advantage of us.</P>

<P>#5. What is the most interesting thing you have learned this month?</P>

<P>The book I read this month, Being Digital by Nicholas Negroponte, was
really an excellent source for my topic. Because the book was very informative
and yet very clear and easy to read, I was able to pull a lot of information
from it which should help in my report. One of the most interesting points
that he helped me to see was our level of technology and what the future
holds. Think of the computers of the 1940s and 1950s. They filled entire
air-conditioned rooms and they could process a few thousand pieces of information
per second. Over time, the size of computers was reduced from a large room
to a small closet, then to a desktop, and now into the palm of your hand.
They have not only gotten smaller, they have gotten more powerful. For
instance, a typical graphing calculator of today is more than 1,000 times
more powerful and a tiny fraction of the size of the ENIAC, the first computer
developed in the late 1940s. Because computers have become small enough,
powerful enough, and cheap enough, the next logical step is that they will
soon become interconnected in a giant network. Evidence of this trend is
already evident in the Internet, which currently connects over 30 million
computers. Many other digital objects can be interfaced to a computer today,
items such as personal organizers, calculators, and even wristwatches.
Someday they will all be able to communicate; your wristwatch may use satellites
to communicate with a toaster in Australia. It is still unclear what the
two might talk about, but the possibility does exist.</P>

<P>#6. Based on what you have read and researched so far, how do you feel
about your topic? Should you refocus any aspect of it? Should you change
any of the sub questions?</P>

<P>After looking into my topic a bit, I still think it is an interesting
and valid topic. I do have some concerns about its scope, however. It is
an extremely broad topic and I may not be able to do more than just scratch
the surface. New technologies are changing our culture so quickly and profoundly
that it may prove impossible to investigate all of its aspects in a relatively
short paper. While it may prove necessary to choose one area of computer
technologies or one specific problem, the interconnected nature of computers
makes this difficult. It may also prove beneficial to alter some of my
sub questions. For one thing, the phrase ‘computer technology’ should be
changed to ‘digital technology’ to help clear up the misconception that
a computer is only an object that sits on a desk. This solution could cause
other problems though, as it would make my topic even more broad than it
already is. Another change needs to be made in that some of the sub questions
have turned out to be repeats. For instance, one question asks about how
computers are both helpful and harmful to society, while another asks what
threats computers pose to our society. These questions could easily be
combined, as it is often hard to determine which group to place a piece
of information into.</P>

<P>#7. Evaluate your process. What do you need to change to make your time
more efficiently spent?</P>

<P>Overall I think the process went very well this month. I am usually
very good at putting thing off until the last minute, but I did not find
myself doing that as much. I did get a late start on my book because I
didn’t finish my September report until the 30th. Once I did finish my
book and wrote the report, it was nice to have the report in early because
then I didn’t have to worry about it. That extra time allowed me to get
a head start on my November book, which should make things easier. I like
the process of taking notes on 3” by 5” cards and then filing them into
a box. The result is clear and makes it easy to find a reference to a particular
topic. It is a little hard to carry the cards and a pen wherever I carry
the book, but it does make the process simpler. The other problem I ran
into was this journal. Because I did not have exact dates set to do each
journal entry, they tended to get lumped to the end of the grading period.
However, I was able to get them done, but it may be easier if I set dates
to get them done by. While my process may need some refinements to make
better use of my time, it is overall good. Once I make some slight changes
to avoid procrastination, it should prove a very effective method for finishing
tasks on time.</P>

<P>#1. How do you define your topic?</P>

<P>In the subject of digital technology, one word that obviously needs
to be defined is digital. Many different definitions exist for this word,
but all of them come down to the same thing. Digital appliances use bits,
tiny pieces of information in the form of a 1 or 0, to preform various
functions. The terms computer and digital appliance are synonymous. All
digital machines perform computations, which makes them computers, and
all computers use digital logic, which makes them digital appliances. The
only difference lies in our interpretation. We see a computer as a box
that one places on a desk, whereas a digital appliance could be anything
from a digital clock to the brains of the space shuttle. Another important
concept in digital technology is the opposite of digital, or analog. Digital
logic is comprised of a series of distinct states comprised of a 1 or 0.
Because the digit can't be between 1 or 0, then there are only a finite
number of states. Analog, on the other hand, has no distinct states, and
therefore has an infinite number of possible states. This means that analog
technology is more precise because it has an infinite number of possible
states, whereas digital is limited to a finite number of possibilities.
For this same reason, however, digital is more accurate. For example, a
digital signal might be exactly 5, whereas an analog signal might be 4.9
or 5.1. This is why digital technologies are used in applications such
as CDs and computers, the exactness of the signal makes it less prone to
static and other interference. Another important term that must be defined
is technology. One simple definition of technology is any sort of tool
whose purpose is to benefit or advance mankind. Using this definition,
computers can certainly be considered a form of technology, as they help
mankind. Computers were first created to help mankind solve problems, and
they now provide a way to keep us organized and make us more efficient.
The development of digital technologies has been one of the greatest technological
achievements of this century.</P>

<P>#2. What character can you see operating within your topic?</P>

<P>Selecting a hero for a topic such as digital technology is quite a difficult
task due to the recent nature of the problems. The character would have
to be aware of future trends and have a good working knowledge of our current
technology. He would most likely be a common man who is caught up in the
problems of technology just like the rest of us. He would have to be an
example to us all, someone who truly knows how to deal with the perils
of technology. Ah yes, I have the perfect super hero... George Jetson.
Because he comes from the future, George certainly has a supreme awareness
of future trends. He has a robotic maid, Rosie, an automated house, and
even a hover car. He came from a time where the technology is far more
advanced that ours. He has learned to cope with the technology, at least
to an extent. Although he has learned to embrace much of the technology,
it never ceases to confound and intimidate him. We often see him having
problems with the technology, whether it be not being able to get something
to work or not knowing how to make something work the way he wants. He
struggles with the complications of technology in much the same way we
do. Yet he is able to overcome there struggles. Despite the fact that he
is often intimidated or confused by the technology around him, George is
still able to use the technology to his advantage. We see him trying to
learn new things, and always trying to keep up with the newest gadgets
in order to stay ahead. He has learned to make the technology an extension
of himself, to use it as a tool for bettering mankind. He teaches us all
a valuable lesson, that in order for the technology to be able to help
mankind, we must be able to use it to our advantage. We must embrace the
technology or else it is meaningless to us. Though he may appear to the
untrained eye as a scrawny and mistreated cartoon character, George Jetson
is really using his half hour each week to show us the path to true wisdom.
He teaches us that we must learn to embrace new technology in order for
it to fulfill its destiny to help mankind. George Jetson provides us with
an example and gives children a roll model. He has the power to show us
the future and what it will take to get there. </P>

<P>#3. What new perspectives have you gained for your topic?</P>

<P>After reading many books, I have gained a lot of insight into my topic.
Before I began with this topic of study, I was not aware of the true conflicts
between human thought and computer thought. I was also not aware of the
great divide between those with access to computer technology and those
without. Researching my topic through both fiction and non-fiction books
has proven very helpful in finding ideas and gaining new perspectives on
my topic. One author makes note of the great difference in the way computers
and humans think. In general, computers think scientifically and not creatively.
They solve problems using exact sequences and not by improvising. They
use only the concrete, never the abstract. This belief in the concrete
over the abstract has spread to the human race from computers. In medieval
times people followed religion on blind faith, believing that everything
is the way it is because that's the way their god or gods wanted it. Today
we have much the same belief, only in science instead of religion. We believe
everything that our scientists say is true, and we often take it on blind
faith. If they say that vitamin C can prevent a cold, we don't ask for
proof. We also see the computer as the perfect scientist. It is 100% objective,
unbiased, and never makes mistakes. This view is misleading, however, as
a computer is subject to the views of its programmer. Any programmer can
input the desired data in order to achieve the desired result. In short,
we have become dependent upon computers as the source of all of life's
answers, when it in fact has no capabilities beyond those we give it. Another
problem I could not see is that of the divide between the 'haves' and the
'have nots' in our technical society. Because computers and the research
that comes from them are cutting edge technologies, there is only a small
group of people at the top of the technological pyramid. These people control
the access to the knowledge created at the cutting edge of technology,
and they will inevitably form a kind of monopoly by holding the knowledge
for themselves. This leads to the large separation between those who possess
the knowledge and those who do not. The cycle continues when another group
advances the cutting edge and creating new knowledge, breaking up the old
monopoly and forming a new one. This pattern is harmful to our society
because it leads to the uneven distribution of technology among everyone.</P>

<P>#4. What is the most interesting thing you have learned this month?</P>

<P>The most interesting thing I discovered was the history of computers
and of computing itself. While the first computer was invented in this
century, the first computations date back to prehistoric times. The history
is interesting to follow as it moves through history. The path to today's
computer is a long one, beginning very long ago. The first major development
in mathematics came in the time of the early romans. The roman numeral
system does not have a character for the number zero, which made complex
computations impossible. Once the concept of zero was established, the
study of mathematics flourished, and continued to develop for many years
to come. As the study of mathematics became more complicated and the numbers
started getting larger and more precise, the need for a machine that was
capable of preforming logical mathematical operations became apparent.
The first man to attempt such a machine was Charles Babbage, who built
the numerical engine in the early 1800's. While this mechanical computer
did not meet the requirements of today's definition of computer because
it was not digital, it was the first example of a computing machine. The
next major step came during World War II when the military wanted a machine
that could calculate the range and trajectories of their ballistics. The
answer was the ENIAC, the world's first true digital computer. The ENIAC
was large enough to fill a huge air-conditioned room, and it was only able
to run at a speed of 1 calculation for every 2 seconds (today's desktop
computers are capable of over 300 million calculations per second). In
fact, the term bug, or computer glitch, came from the ENIAC. One day the
machine stopped (as it often did), and one of the programmers had to go
into the room where the 'brains' were kept to remove a moth that had been
zapped in the electronic circuitry. The next step came a short time later
in 1947 when Bell Laboratories invented the transistor. They were superior
to the tubes used in the first computers because they were far smaller,
less expensive, faster, cheaper, and more reliable than the tubes. When
the new transistors were first placed on a small chip, the microprocessor
was born. Today a microprocessor may have as many as 2.5 million transistors.
With the new innovations in technology, computers began to drop in both
size and cost while increasing in performance and capability. We saw the
computer move from a huge room to a small closet, to a large desktop box,
to a laptop model, and now to tiny palmtop computers. With every step they
became faster and less expensive. The future of computing is still unknown,
but if the past is any indication, we are in for quite a show.</P>

<P>#5. Evaluate your process.</P>

<P>The process that I have been using has, for the most part, been very
efficient. I feel that my time has been well spent and that I am able to
keep up. This is not to say that a few of my methods couldn't be changed,
however. Overall I think I am progressing as planned and perhaps just a
few minor refinements are in order. The system I have been using to keep
notes on the books I read, keeping notes on 3&quot; x 5&quot; note cards
and filing them into a box works very well for writing reports. All I have
to do is to pull the cards out for the appropriate sub-question and I have
all of my quotes. While I am reading the book, however, the system is a
little more inconvenient. It means that every time I find a quote I have
to transcribe it onto a card, determine the appropriate sub-question, and
file it accordingly. Due to the complexity of the procedure, I find myself
skipping quotes that may be significant. One helpful technique I have found
is to mark the quote (in pencil, of course) and then transcribe it later.
This also helps because I see the quote from a new perspective and am able
to file it more accurately. This also means that I don't have to carry
an index card box everywhere I take my book. Another problem I have run
into is truly a classic one for me: procrastination. I have become an expert
at waiting until the last minute, and this is one habit I really need to
change. The natural enemy to the procrastination bug is the setting of
deadlines, which I am guilty of not doing. I have found that when I do
set deadlines for myself, I often maintain them and finish well in advance.
This makes for far less stress and a better end result. I have also found
that starting on a project, no matter how small a start, has extremely
beneficial results. At the very least, it causes me to think about the
topic and work out my points in my head, so that I know exactly what to
say when I do sit down to write it. I also find that by just having the
project on my mind I am more likely to work on it, even if it is only in
small chunks. Lastly, because I have already made some progress, I see
only the next step and not the daunting mountain of work that a whole project
may entail. I think that I am winning the war against procrastination,
but ultimate victory will require lots of hard work and self-discipline.
Or perhaps I'll be so busy that I just won't have time to procrastinate,
which I can always do later. My overall process has worked fairly well
so far. Because I've taken the trouble to put quotes from the books onto
cards, the reports and summaries are much simpler and clearer. While I
do still battle with procrastination, I have found techniques to keep it
at bay. By making some simple modifications to my processes, I can greatly
increase the efficiency and quality while reducing the stress.</P>

<H2><A NAME="december"></A>December</H2>

<P>#1. What is the most pivotal event in the history of your topic? This
problem is actually not a new one. There have always been underpriveledged
people in our society, but the differences have always been in different
areas. The rich have always and will continue to struggle with the poor,
the rich want to stay in power while the poor want a chance for themselves.
In this case, the problem manifests itself through the use of computers.
The rich can afford computers, and can therefore learn how to use them.
The poor cannot afford such luxuries, so they must do without suck fancy
things. They then can't learn how to use a computer, and they get stuck
in a low-paying job. The low-paying job explains their poverty, and the
cycle repeats itself. By introducing an equalizer, such as government-sponsored
free computer education for all people, I hope to end this endless cycle.
A pivotal event would show a new awareness onto my problem was with the
advent of the home computer. The Apple II is considered the first true
home computer, it became available in the late 1970s. This was the first
time in history that anyone who could afford it could buy a computer for
themselves. Those who liked to play with computers and those who had extra
money lying around were eager to purchase one, but the poor could not afford
it. Some schools bought them, but they were never integrated into the curriculum.
There were no computers available to the general public because they were
too new and too expensive. Basically, the poor had no way to access one.
This is the foundation of my problem, and the first time that it began
to affect people in the way that it does today.</P>

<P>#2. What is the most moral or ethical issue pertaining to your issue?</P>

<P>The major moral decision in my topic is the decision of whether it is
fair to withhold new technology from someone just because they are not
as advantaged. If past precedents were to be the deciding factor, than
nothing would be changed. Our society has always been in favor of the rich
and against the poor. As a nation we do not treat everyone equally, and
we never have. While our Declaration of Independence states that “all men
are created equal,” we have never had a problem with the rich being rich
while the poor remain poor. This brings up the issue of whether it is right
for one group to have all of the advantages while another does not. In
the past those who have been able to afford the investment in computer
technology have been the only ones who have seen its uses. Access is then
restricted to those who have little money, certainly not enough for a computer..
Is this equality? I would suggest that it is not. If all men are created
equal, how could this happen? What happened to our right to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of bits? Maybe that's not how the Declaration goes, but
it's basically the same thing. If we are equal, shouldn't we all have access
to a machine as amazing as a computer? If it promises to be the machine
that ushers in the next millennium, shouldn't we all have access. This
does truly represent a moral issue that we must resolve.</P>

<P>#3. What is the post controversial issue pertaining to your topic?</P>

<P>There really isn't much controversy surrounding my topic. The problem
is fairly obvious, and the solution is quite simple. Everyone needs a computer,
or at least access to one. Without that, certain members of our society
will continue to be poor while the technological revolution leaves them
behind. We simply can not have this in our society. We need to work together.
Probably the most controversial portion is about why the government fails
to provide adequate access to computers both for schoolchildren and adults.
It was only this year that our school procured an adequate number of computers
with internet connections, and many other schools are still far behind.
The government has not made it a priority to put computers into schools,
and consequently we see some school systems that can hardly afford teachers
and books, much less computers. The government need to set aside funding
to put computers into schools, but that's another issue entirely. Another
part of this issue is the lack of free computer access to adults. Very
few sites have computers ate the general disposal of the public, and very
few of those are free. The library offers two computers for internet and
one for word-processing, which is not enough for the average community
of about 10,000. There is no one to teach you how to use the computer,
either, only a very limited facility with computers. The government must
again step in to encourage a change. We need to fight for equal digital
rights. Why should anyone be left behind?</P>

<P>#4. Create a victim in you problem area.</P>

<P>I'd like to introduce you to Mark Smith. He lives in inner-city New
York with his single mom and his two sisters. Mark is just entering high
school while his sisters are in grade school, and he feels a sense of duty
toward them and his mother because there is no father figure in his life.
Because they live in the inner-city and have little chance for advancement,
his family is very poor. His mother works days at the K-Mart almost 5 miles
away and nights at the McDonald's down the street. She works very hard,
but her income is simply not enough for a family of four. Mark is taking
computer class at his high school because he hopes the experience will
help him get a job in the future. He is wrong. Because Mark's school has
very little money, it can not afford to buy new computers. The ones used
in the labs are so old that learning to use them has no practical value.
The skills taught on the computer are useless to Mark, keyboarding and
such. The computers are so old that they can not be connected to the internet,
which again means that Mark is missing out. Mark wants to help his family
by making something of himself and getting a better job that working at
a fast-food restaurant, but his lack of computer skills will prove to be
a liability in the future. No employer wants to hire someone who can't
even use the latest computers. What mark needs is both new technology and
an instructor that can help him use it. This is the purpose of a community
computing center, to provide a place for Mark to learn real skills on the
computer. With such a service, Mark can easily go to work designing web
pages or calculating expenses in a spreadsheet. These skills are much more
valuable to an employer than the ability to push a broom. Someone needs
to help in order to let Mark use his full talent to help his family.</P>

<P>#5. What degree of progress are you making in your research?</P>

<P>I feel that my research is coming along fairly well. I have had some
problems coming up with appropriate sources for my topic. The scope of
my narrowed topic is quite specific, and I worry about being able to find
fiction works that relate. As of yet I have been able to find interesting
and informative books, though I may run into some problems in the future.
I feel that I have a very good understanding of my topic. I can see that
there is a problem, and I am working on finding numbers and statistics
to back it up. I have not found any case studies or specific examples yet,
however. I do feel comfortable as I start looking for solutions. I have
seen a number of different propositions, and I side with the establishment
of community centers in which to place computers and teachers. I have also
seen plans that would give a tax break to any poor person who buys a computer,
but that would cost well over $1 billion. The first method would be smaller
and more localized, more efficient, and hopefully a lot cheaper since the
government is buying a few computers for a community instead of one computer
for each family in the community. My sub questions need to be changes because
they are very non-specific. I especially need to concentrate on questions
involving the equal access to computers and how that can be achieved. A
change to eliminate some of the less specific ones would be beneficial,
and adding some new ones might also help me to focus in on my new and updated
topic.</P>

<H2><A NAME="january"></A>January</H2>

<P>#1. What would the environment of your problem look like?</P>

<P>It's hot, like it always is in the city. Looking around the only things
one can see is the broken glass lying everywhere and the run-down apartments
that seem to be sagging under the weight of the problems inside. These
are the needy, the poor, the destitute, and the helpless. Neighborhoods
like this one face problems with crime, drugs, violence, and countless
other problems. People in the neighborhoods are only there because they
have nowhere else to go. Everyone says that they will get out someday,
but few ever do. They can never afford to live anywhere else, even if they
must pay with their lives to stay where they are. The oppressed and downtrodden
flock to such places. They do not do it by choice, there is just nowhere
else for them. The air does not contain even a glimmer of hope, the faintest
whiff of success, of a mere feel of pride. The people do not smile, there
is no such activity in this part of the city. Children do not play in the
streets, their mothers rightfully fear violence and drugs might come their
way. There is no joy only sorrow around every corner and in every room.
Sounds pretty bleak, huh? Many would say that the last thing anyone might
see around here is a computer. The problems within these communities go
far beyond anything we have experienced, how could a computer possibly
help these people? Can such a simple little device really lift them out
of the slums and into a new life? For now, the people go on the same way
they always have, the only way they know how. Perhaps someday a new technology
will help these people to find new meaning in their lives, or perhaps it
is only a dream that can never be reached. We must decide.</P>

<P>#2. Discuss your need for change.</P>

<P>Many different people are being harmed. Those who can not afford to
keep up in the digital race are being harmed by companies that are increasingly
demanding employees to have more computer experience. Children are being
harmed because they do not have any exposure to the internet and other
computer software that could potentially help them immensely. We are all
being harmed because we are not all allowed to perform to the limit of
our talents. While they might not be to direct cause of the harm, our government
certainly contributes to it. Though we do know of all of the benefits of
computers, our government still refuses to invest is a technology that
will help our children and our country. The number of computers found in
schools is extremely limited, and the number of computers available to
adults is near zero. Computers are such an important tool, how can our
own government fail to provide access to such a crucial technology. The
numbers can be quite staggering. The difference in home computers between
blacks and whites is nearly two to one, and the difference between rich
and poor is far greater. As long as there are poor citizens of America,
this will continue to be a problem. The difference in pay for those with
computer skills is also quite astounding. I have seen figures as high as
ten to fifteen percent pay difference, which represents quite a large difference
in quality of life. The government is set up to perpetuate the harm. Due
to their lack of action, the government has watched as the problem became
worse, and will do so in the future. Funding also becomes an issue, and
our government seems to be so adamantly against any kind of funding, especially
in schools. Many things will need to be changed within our government to
produce effective change.</P>

<P>#3. Discuss solutions you have found so far.</P>

<P>The most outrageous solution I have found was proposed by Newt Gingrich
himself. During a news conference, he proposed a $1,000 tax break towards
the purchase of a computer. This move was highly ridiculed by the press,
and the costs associated were tremendous. I have seen estimates of $1 billion
just to pay for computers for the poor. This solution obviously isn't the
one. The best solution I have found is one that has been carried out successfully
in a number of places around the country. This particular solution involves
placing computers all around the city and allowing the public to use them
whenever they want. Centers are established, often with donated equipment,
and volunteers are brought in to help train people to use the foreign machines.
This solution is very realistic. The large amount of donated equipment
helps to keep the cost down although quality may be sacrificed. The solution
helps a large number of people to use computers. It does not only provide
access, like Mr. Gingrich's plan, but it also provides tutors to help people
overcome their fear of technology and learn to use the computer as a tool
to help themselves. This solution does work in nearly every community it
is tried in. The new technology offers people benefits that they otherwise
might never have had, while it teaches them that they can do it, they can
accomplish something. Computers may provide a way to break the cycle, we
must concentrate on finding such alternatives. This plan seems like the
best one overall. The cost can be very reasonable, especially if parts
and labor are available from volunteers. It has already proven very effective
in some areas, and the benefits have been enormous. I think this will be
my ultimate choice for a final solution, since it seems to make the most
sense and solves the problem better than any of the others.</P>

<P>#4. How would you change things in an ideal world?</P>

<P>The first thing I would change is to give everyone money. Our country
is founded on the belief that all people are created equal, so let's make
all of the people equal. I don't like the idea of one man being entitled
to more than another man, so I feel that the government should decide who
should get what. We should all give everything we own to the government
and then let them distribute it all equally among us. Hasn't that been
tried somewhere? The next step would be to make computers cheaper. Great
advancements in computers have already made them faster and better, now
how about cheaper. The best way to accomplish this would be to turn the
production of the computer over to the government. It is so inefficient
to have hundreds of manufacturers producing thousands of different models
of computers, when all we really need is one kind of computer for everyone.
Because it could be built in much higher bulk, it would be significantly
cheaper. This would also make calls to tech support much simpler because
you would never have to know the model of computer you have. The third
and final change that I would make would be to get rid of the humans. We
humans seem to spend all of our time worrying about whether we are being
oppressed and trying to find problems everywhere we look that we never
have time to come up with solutions. Robots are much simpler because they
do not actually have to think, they are all simply told what to do (by
the government). This also gets rid of those pesky human emotions. While
today's problem is certainly a very serious one, I need to find a compromise
between the status quo and robotic socialism. There is no perfect world,
there is only our world. This does not mean, however, that we can't try
to make it the best imperfect world as possible!</P>

<H2><A NAME="february"></A>February</H2>

<P>#1 For one or two plans under consideration, discuss desirability, workability,
and practicality.</P>

<P>One plan that I am considering would be to place computers and instructors
into public places. This would help because it would allow access to computers
for anyone who wants to use them. Placing them in a public place, such
as a library or community center, would allow access to the computers without
forcing under-privileged families to purchase their own computer. The instructors
would be either provided by the library or community center or volunteers
and would be available to citizens for instruction at certain times during
the week. This plan would be very desirable. It would allow anyone and
everyone access to a computer and to a trained staff to teach them how
to use it. This would allow the access to the Internet, e-mail, and other
computer programs to anyone. Learning how to use the computers as well
as having computers available for use solves the problem very simply and
with minimal expense, and is therefore very desirable. This solution is
slightly less workable. The major problem with workability comes with funding
for the project. The computers would either have to come from the government
or they would have to be donated, which would be unlikely. The government
would have to seek special funds, which would be difficult to do. Corporations
are not likely to donate computers because they are not likely to get anything
in return. Finding money to pay the instructors would also prove to be
a challenge. These could potentially be volunteers because they need only
be available on a limited basis. If they were paid employees, however,
the funding would need to come from the government or from donations, which
is again unlikely. This plan would have a difficult time in finding general
funding, which is why it has a low workability. Making computers available
to the general public would be a fairly practical solution, but it would
have its limitations. It would be able to give people crucial computer
experience and training, like the ability to research something on the
Internet. It would also allow them to type and use word processing software.
The process becomes a little less convenient, however, when someone wants
to type a quick letter or report and has to go all the way to the library
to do it. This method would also discourage games and other sorts of applications
because they waste the valuable resources. It would provide people with
practical knowledge about computers, but nothing more. For this reason,
it would receive a mediocre practicality score.</P>

<P>#2 If your harm were to continue, where would you stand in 2050 or 2100?
Create a scenario with future trends.</P>

<P>If the under-privileged in our society were to go on without any computer
knowledge, a large split would open up between those who can use computers
and those who cannot. The gap in income would become even larger than today’s
15%. Those who made more money could afford still more technology, while
those who do not know how to use the technology would be left in the dust.
This would lead to a world in which there are two groups, the rich and
the poor, the haves and the have-nots. Because those who cannot use the
new technology make more money, they become richer. They are the ones who
live in the big house with the new Mercedes hovercar parked on the pad.
They can afford a better education for their children and send them to
any ivy-league school they choose. Because their children have a better
education, their children will be able to make even more money. The rich
will get richer. The poor citizens are also caught in a cycle. Theirs,
on the other hand, will not make them richer. The poor citizens have no
money and cannot afford the new technology that is available to the wealthy.
Because they have no other means of accessing the technology, they do not
know how to use it. It’s not in their schools because the government can’t
afford to invest in its future (it’s too busy, say, trying to help the
homeless in Somalia). Of course the wealthy children still have it in their
schools because their parents can afford to send them to private schools.
Because the average poor citizen has no access to the technology, he does
not know how to use it. He then gets stuck in a lower-paying job that doesn’t
require and computer knowledge, like flipping spaceburgers. The cycle then
starts again, with each generation having less money than the one before
it. The poor will get poorer. Okay, so maybe computers won’t split the
country in half. They probably won’t lead to a two class system in the
United States were computer users are at the top and everyone else sits
at the bottom, either. But they may very well help to widen the gap between
rich and poor. Those who have access to the newest technology will be able
to stay on top, while those without access will only fall further behind.
The problem becomes potentially severe in that the two cycles only further
divide the haves and have-nots as time passes. A solution must be found.
Yes, computer access for all! By providing access to the newest technology
to all citizens, the problem of access is solved. The poor now have access
to the same technology that the wealthy can afford, and because they have
access, they can now acquire the skills. Once they master the skills behind
the technology, they can find a job that requires the use of computers.
The poor can then make more money and cycle has been broken. Alas, the
World is saved!</P>

<P>#3 What laws would the government pass to curb your problem? What would
the effects be by 2050 or 2100?</P>

<P>Providing computers in public places would probably not require the
passage of any new laws, but it would require the government to create
some funding. In order to pay for any new computers or to provide a trained
staff, some money would need to be set aside for the projects. This money
would most likely come from the government. Putting computer literacy and
skills programs into any political campaign would certainly be productive,
as it would benefit a large portion of the voting public. It would then
be a simple matter of setting aside some money in the budget for computer
education in the community. Sources of funding would probably be mostly
federal with some state and local dollars. The decisions on how to spend
the money would be left to the local level, because they would best know
where the money is needed most. Other sources of funding could include
private and corporate donations, but should no include fees for computer
use or instruction as this would completely undermine the entire point
of these programs. Any sort of fee would once again prevent the poor from
using the computers, which would only leave the project right where it
started, with the under-privileged having no access to computers The second
duty for the government would be to create the actual programs. They would
first need to select and establish a site, one that could be accessed by
all members of the community. One a site is located, they would need to
decide what type and how many computers to purchase. The computers chosen
must be of a good enough quality that they can run all of today’s software
and be adaptable to tomorrow’s technology, but the cannot be so expensive
that only a few will fit into the budget. A qualified staff must also be
selected to assist in computer instruction. One the public computing center
becomes operational, the general public must be notified of its existence,
and so some money would need to be spent on advertising and promotion.
Ongoing expenses would include the staff’s salary, maintenance for the
computers and the site, and possible upgrades for the computers. One alternative
is to make the staff volunteers, which would eliminate the employees’ salaries
from the final price tags. This would be feasible because the majority
of the staff would only teach computer skills, which could be accomplished
at one daily or weekly class, as long as some tutoring is provided throughout
the day. This scenario would lead to an adequate solution to the problem.
It would provide access for all and an opportunity to learn and use the
computers. Computer skills are essential in today’s job market, and such
a plan would give anyone the computer skills necessary to find employment.
This plan would benefit society as a whole by helping each individual.</P>

<P>#4 Brainstorm some ideas on the planks listed for your plan.</P>

<P>a. Name of plan or initiative Names may vary by the locality who sets
up and administers the program, but the name should convey a sense of community
as well as computer education. Some examples might include “ZionNet” or
“Zionsville Community Computer Center.” The national initiative might be
called “Access to Equality” or “CAREER” (Computer Access Resulting in Equal
Employment Rights).</P>

<P>b. Organizer The plan as a whole would be organized by a national director.
This person would be responsible for spreading the federal money among
the states and localities as well as coordinating the effort as a whole.
Under this person would be coordinators for each state who would serve
to further divide the money between localities. Most of the responsibility
would fall onto the local coordinators, who would determine what and where
the local project would be.</P>

<P>c. Method of implementation The plan would be implemented by the committees.
Each local committee or director would decide exactly how the project should
be implemented and then act accordingly.</P>

<P>d. Timeline The federal, state, and local directors would be selected
and hired as soon as the project is put into our country’s budget. These
should be hired within two months of the passage of the budget. The federal
and state directors will begin researching and dividing the finances, while
the local directors will begin researching appropriate sites and selecting
computers. This portion of the plan should take no more than four months,
unless a new facility is to be built. The computers should then be set
up and a trained staff found in the next four months. This gives the project
a maximum timeline of 10 months from the time that money is appropriated
in the federal budget to the time that the computer center doors open for
the first time.</P>

<P>e. Location The task of finding a location for each locality would fall
onto the local coordinator. Primary possibilities may include libraries
and community centers, but other appropriate locations may be found. Another
alternative would be to build a building solely for the purpose of a computer
center, but this would be a far more costly option. Locating the center
in a library or computer center would provide convenient accessibility
as well as free rent.</P>

<P>f. Finances The majority of the money would come from the federal government.
This project would be easy to add to the federal budget because it would
potentially help a lot of people with a minimum of cost. Other funding
might also come from the state and local levels, but these would not be
expected to absorb the majority of the costs. Funding could possibly come
from corporate or private donations, but this would only be used as a last
resort.</P>

<P>g. Education/awareness/publicity Once the project is near completion
in each locality, it will be the responsibility of the local coordinator
to publicize the center. These could be in the form of local advertisements,
local announcements, or schools. Publicity for the program would also occur
at the federal level, with promotions of the programs through advertisements
and public awareness campaigns.</P>

<P>#1. If you were one of the people operating within your solution, which
person would you be?</P>

<P>If I could have any of the jobs within my solution, I would be the tutor
who teaches people about computers. I am certainly qualified because I
know very well how to use a computer and I like showing people things they
have never seen before and doing things they have never done before. I
have had a lot of experience with the people in my family, and my mom is
a bit of a repeat customer. I enjoy working with computers, and something
like this would be very gratifying to me. Watching someone use the computer
for the first time is truly amazing. At first people fear technology, which
may be one of the reasons that they have never bothered to use it. Computers
scare them, because they can be so foreign. The idea seems far-fetched,
like ‘I could never learn to use one of those things.’ The person has probably
grown curious after hearing their friends talking about the internet and
hearing ‘www dot blah-blah dot com’ wherever they go. Then the person makes
their first steps. After a while they say ‘I can do this!’ The person has
learned that technology is not something to be feared, that it can be very
helpful and very intuitive as well. As they continue to gain in capability
they explore the limits of what they can do. Someone might want to look
up their favorite subject on the internet and find something of personal
relevance. In a matter of minutes the person changes from someone who was
afraid of technology to someone who is eager to take the next step. I would
like that job.</P>

<P>#2. If you were giving a speech, what idea would you you want to convey?</P>

<P>This topic is especially relevant, because I plan to give a speech to
the class once I have finished my inquiry. I would convey everything that
the class needs to know in order to understand the problem, the solution,
and why I chose to do what I have done. The first step it to explain the
problem. This is fairly simple, I just explain that the unequal access
to computers in our society is quite a problem. Explaining why it is a
problem is also rather simple. The lack of computer knowledge leads to
lower paying jobs, approximately 15% lower, in fact. It also deprives the
person of a right given to everyone else, and it deprives them of a tool
that is so useful to the rest of society. The last step effectively proved
the harm that exists. I would at this point do a demonstration to prove
that those without computer knowledge will not perform as well. This will
help to drive the point home. Once harm has sufficiently been proven, it's
time to move on to what we can do about it. At this point I will explain
my solution. I want to set up computer centers inside public high schools
and make theses sites available to the general public. I will go on to
explain some of the details of the plan, such as the hours of operation
and the expected cost, but not so many details that the plan gets lost.
The point that I would like to convey most is the need for action. The
solution can be great on paper, but if that's where it stops than what
was the point of spending all of my time on this inquiry. Even if it starts
small and then is allowed to grow, implementing the plan is the only way
to see the results that it was designed to achieve. At the end of my speech,
I will answer all of the class's questions about my problem or solution,
take a round of applause, and return to my seat.</P>

<P>#3. Discuss how one of your inquiry projects describes who you are.</P>

<P>I spent a good deal of time choosing which projects I will do right
from the beginning. I knew that how I can get my message out says a lot
about how I feel about my project. It also says a lot about me. The project
that I plan to do that says the most about me is the internet site. I have
always loved computers. We now have six computers in our home, though only
two of them are from the last decade. I was raised playing games on an
old Apple II, then we won our first of four Macintoshes from the Shoe Carnival
in 1986. From the first time we turned it on I was the expert, the man
in the family who could make it work. For a while I had the nickname ‘macman’
around the house. The tradition has continues, as the most recent of our
four Macs arrived only 4 days ago. I also greatly enjoy doing website design.
It's a kind of art form, manipulating the bits and the elements of a page
to get it to come out exactly as I want. Making a page with style and interesting
information can be very hard, not to mention very time-consuming. It can
also be very fun. Each time I finish a page in HTML (the language used
to design pages) and I view it enough to work out all of the kinks, I feel
satisfaction. As an artist I am terrible, but on the computer I can make
what's on the screen match the idea I have in my head. I will not only
use my page as a means of communication, but as a means of expression.
I like to challenge myself, and this provides the perfect challenge. I
can set goals of what I want to see on the screen and then see if I can
figure out how to make it a reality. Maybe it's just the nerd in me, but
I think there's nothing better than looking on the internet and seeing
something that I made, there for all to see.</P>

<P>#4. If you were to select the four most valuable sources, which four
would they be?</P>

<P>The best resource I had for my inquiry was Being Digital, by Nicholas
Negroponte. I especially liked this book because it was written is such
clear language that was very readable. He could take the most complicated
of subjects and reduce it to just its elements to make it understandable
to even the least computer-literate reader. When I read it from him, everything
made perfect sense. He explained exactly what computers are, how they can
do what they do, what they can offer us, and what our future will be like
with computers. To do all of this in a way that is readable to and average
person is quite a feat, too! Another book I found very helpful was entitled
Robots, Androids, and Animatrons by John Iovine. The title sounds like
a science-fiction tale, but the book is actually quite informative. It
told a lot about the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence, which
are both closely tied with the computer. The book also contained experiments
where the reader can actually build simple and not-so-simple robots form
the simple parts and instructions listed in the book. Not to give anything
away, but you may be seeing some of his ideas during my speech. The most
helpful magazine article I came across was called “The Haves and Have-Nots,”
by LynNell Hancock. This was one of the few sources I had whose sole point
was the same as mine, which made the article very easy to use in my reports.
She told of the problems and effects of unequal computer access and provided
statistics to back herself up. She also gave several personal stories and
case studies that I found useful throughout my inquiry. I only wish I had
longer and more detailed sources with the same focus available to me. The
best fiction book that I read was Society of the Mind by Eric L. Harry.
This book had a very intriguing story line while presenting problems with
computers ate the same time. The main focus of the book was about the computer's
challenge to mankind and how digital evolution is superior to biological
evolution. The specifics might not have been very helpful, but the book
was quite enjoyably. I plan to read as many more of his books as I can
find.</P>

<H2><A NAME="april"></A>April</H2>

<P>#1. What is the most interesting thing you have learned during the inquiry?</P>

<P>While working on my inquiry, I have learned a lot of things. For one,
I have greatly improved on my time management skills. Setting personal
deadlines allowed me to get things in ahead of schedule, for a change.
I have learned a lot about my topic as well, about computers and their
uses. What I have learned the most, however, is about looking at a topic
from a different perspective. This arose from my indecision on a topic,
then finally narrowing it down to one that never occurred to me. When I
began the inquiry in September, my topic was very broad. I knew I wanted
to do something involving computers and the many problems they might cause,
but I didn’t want to narrow it down for fear of missing something important.
I went a long time with my overarching question reading “How might we,
as a society, utilize computer technology to our advantage?” This led to
many problems as it became hard to narrow it down to one topic. I tried
computers taking away “ functions vital to our humanity,” such as our decision
making ability and the like. I tried to use the approach that robots are
taking away jobs from factory workers, but that was hard to find any statistical
data to back that up. Ultimately I knew that I needed to find a real problem
to come up with a solution, and nothing I had tried so far was working.
This is where creativity came into play. I had seen a few articles about
community networks, which is a local network set up to educate people about
computers and to build community spirit as well. It dawned on me that the
reason people were using the computers at such centers was because they
had no alternatives; they could not afford a computer of their own. Then
I read the book The First Twenty Million is Always the Hardest, in which
they spoke of building a ‘Volkswagen PC,’ one that the poor and schools
could afford. This solidified it for me. I knew that the problem of computer
access was truly a problem. Because people don’t have a computer, they
don’t have the opportunity to learn to use one. Because they don’t know
how to use one, they can’t get a job that requires the use of a computer.
This is a cycle that can only be broken when someone learns how to use
a computer. Providing public computers is the perfect solution, it gives
access to computers while still maintaining a reasonable cost. I learned
that sometimes I need to step back and look at what I am doing from a new
angle. This is what allowed me to come up with a problem, and it also came
in handy when I needed to find a solution. Looking at the problem from
a new angle allows for new perspectives and innovative solutions.</P>

<P>#2. What have you learned about yourself from this inquiry?</P>

<P>I have learned most about how I manage my time. This has always been
a problem area for me, as I tend to procrastinate for as long as possible.
This has not been as bad of an experience, because I have learned how to
schedule my time. These skills should help me even more as college approaches,
and I hope to build on them as I enter a lifelong career. The first step
in allocating time for the inquiry was to make a calendar on which to place
due dates. I filled it in with due dates for both rough drafts and final
copies, and in many cases I was able to keep to those. I also set up appointments
with myself on the calendar. While I did not adhere strictly to those appointments,
they were helpful in setting aside ‘inquiry time.’ I found it easiest to
keep my appointment on Sunday, when I am generally the least busy. If no
one sets a due date for me, then I need to set one for myself to get things
in on-time. If I do not set a due date for myself, then I will not start
on it until I absolutely must, which may result in sloppy and hurried work,
not to mention a lot of stress. If I set a due date ahead of the assigned
one, nothing changes, but the paper comes in at my due date, so it is early.
This system is far from perfect, or even good, but it does work. In the
future I hope to feel industrious that I may start to turn things in ahead
of time without imposing deadlines! If the government could only do that
too, imagine what a world we would live in! One of the best ways I have
found to get a paper in early is to start on the paper, however small a
start, as early as I get the assignment. This approach gets me thinking
about the assignment well in advance, and I find myself continuously working
out problems in my head whenever my mind is idle, like when I am shelving
books at the library or trying to sleep. Then when I finally sit down to
write the paper, I find that I already know exactly what I am going to
say, even if I haven’t directly worked on it for more then ten or fifteen
minutes. I used this approach with my inquiry, beginning to try to put
the vision in my head onto the computer in late March. This forced me to
think about it, and I end up working on it one little chunk at a time.
It also helps if I have a positive attitude about a paper as well as how
much I have to do as a whole. Some papers, before I started on them, had
about the same emotional expectancy at a good root canal. In this light,
I did not want to start to even think about a paper until the due date
was little more that a calendar flip away. I see the overall project in
a good light, almost like a challenge. I find myself wanting to work on
it, which is a new feeling altogether for English assignments. As I head
off to college and into the real world, I will face many due dates and
deadlines. I must not let them control me, I must not show them any fear.
My future depends on it!</P>

<P>#3. If you could begin your inquiry again, what would you do differently?</P>

<P>One of the big problems I had with my inquiry was that I didn’t know
what it was about until January. If I could do it over again, I would start
my research with a specific problem in mind. My lack of decision caused
many problems as I researched and reported on my topic. When I first chose
my topic, I knew I wanted to do computers. I came up with that thought
over the summer, and it seemed perfect. There are many problems that need
to be solved, and all of them are quite solvable. The problem is, which
one do I choose. If I pick one then I might be limiting my possibilities,
which I certainly don’t want to do. The answer, then is to be as nonspecific
as possible, because I can always narrow it down later. This logic is what
I actually used during the early stages of my inquiry. I also feared that
if I were to narrow it down too much that I wouldn’t have a big enough
problem to write about. The biggest problem came when I tried to research
my topic. Sitting at a computer and searching for ‘computer’ and ‘problem’
and ‘humanity’ yielded a little more than I was looking for, whatever that
was. Because I didn’t narrow it down to one problem, all of my research
was very broad and ultimately of little help. Many of the books did contain
some information about my topic, but at the time I read them I didn’t know
what to write down. My filing box contains few quotes from early books
on my topic, the quotes just talk about general computer problems. By the
time I had to start writing papers on my topic, I knew I had a problem.
The definition paper was very general, although it did do a good job of
describing how a computer works and what it can do. The problem paper was,
however, a problem. I didn’t know exactly what I was writing about, so
I stated my topic as ‘computes assuming functions vital to our humanity.’
I never really explained what that meant, probably because I had no idea
myself. I had to almost rewrite the paper from scratch when it came time
to compile it into my final inquiry. Once I had finished the paper I decided
to decide on a specific topic for all of my future papers. It was at that
point that I decided on the problems of computer access and computer literacy.
Having a specific topic made all of my future papers far easier and I was
able to focus my research on the single problem. Deciding on a specific
topic right from the beginning would have made this all unnecessary. If
I could do this all over again, as I am sure I will have to at some point,
I would start with a more specific problem around which to focus my research.
This would make the entire process far easier the second time around.</P>

<P>#4. What was the best part of doing the inquiry?</P>

<P>When I first heard about the inquiry, the pink sheet listing the project
points seemed like a nightmare. Imagine that, doing 500 points worth of
work after I finished my paper! It didn’t seem possible, much less fun.
Now the prospects are quite different, I think that the project points
are the best part of my inquiry. As I wrap up the year-long project, I
look forward to the light at the end of the tunnel. While it has been a
long and often bumpy road, I have worked very hard on this project. Now
I am beginning to see the fruits of my labor. As my final paper begins
to grow in length and quality, I can begin to imagine what the final printout
will look like. This project is more than an accumulation of reports, it
is a book! Not just any book, it’s one that I wrote! I never thought I
had the patience or creativity to write a book, but I don’t mind proving
myself wrong. Along with the final inquiry comes the project points. I
decided early on that I would participate in a career mentorship, and I
am very glad that I did. I learned volumes of hands-on experience about
my future major while earning credit for English at the same time. What
a bargain! The inquiry will help me later on as well, because now I know
that electrical engineering truly is the major for me. The next project
I have due is the web page. I thing this is the perfect project for me
because it combines so many of the aspects of my inquiry and my talents.
I love computers, which was a major motivating factor behind my topic,
and I have some experience at Internet authoring. Because my project involves
computers, a computer network seems like the perfect medium for getting
word out. I also am allowed some creativity, as an Internet site is largely
a work of art. I start with a blank canvas, except that mine is digital,
and I create a fluid site that is interesting, informative, and exciting.
I want visitors to learn while having fun. While the process is incredibly
time-consuming, it is also a lot of fun. Lastly on my list of projects
is a presentation to the class. This gives me another opportunity to spread
word of my problem and its solutions. I have been is class with the same
people for almost a year now, so I feel that they owe me at least ten minutes
of their time for me to tell them exactly what I have been doing and what
I have found. I also see this presentation as another chance to be creative
and say what I have to say in a fun yet informative manner. At this point
I plan to do a PowerPoint presentation with some extra demonstrations thrown
in. I want the class to have fun while learning something at the same time,
which is something that is rarely tried. After doing all of this work,
spreading the word on what I have found seems only logical. I see computer
access as a real problem, and I hope that others can see it too. It is
my job to tell them, at least those who want to know. The project points
associated with this project allow me to do just that, to spread the word
to anyone who wants to know. I see this as the best part of my inquiry
because it actually means something, more than just an English paper.</P>

<P>#5. What was the hardest part about doing the inquiry?</P>

<P>The hardest part of the inquiry seems to have been keeping organized.
I do not have a natural tendency to organize, so I often lose things. Much
the same was true for my inquiry, my difficulties in organizing led to
new challenges that I had not even anticipated. The first thing I did was
to set up a box of cards to use when I read books. That way, I could simple
read a book and put any relevant statistics or quotes onto cards and file
them into my little box. This seems a bit extreme, but it did ultimately
help me to stay organized in my references. The problem with this method
is that it is very hard to stick to, carrying around a box of index cards
is somewhat worse than inconvenient. Through-out the course of this project
I had to go to great lengths to stay organized. The problem recurred when
I attempted to organize my research. I had numerous sources from the Internet
and periodicals, but these articles had a habit of walking away. I had
to make a special effort to keep them in the same place so that I would
simply know where they were. The same thing happened when I got papers
back. I would simply insert them into my English binder, from which they
would again wander away. This became a problem when I began revising, as
many of the papers were difficult to locate. Again I was forced to keep
these papers separate from the general population within my backpack to
keep them from becoming commingled. Aside form the organizing of my papers,
I also faced the challenges of the organizing within my papers. I frequently
had trouble with the writing, especially with the transitions between sections,
that led to some of the more poor qualities of my writing. Many of these
problems were corrected during the revision phase, but my tendency to eliminate
transitions in favor of subheadings still exists. A major project such
as this inquiry requires the author to be organized enough to keep all
of the information straight. This proved quite a challenge for me, as I
have a strong tendency against organization. Keeping all of my papers together
long enough to review and correct them was quite difficult, as was organizing
my quotes and statistics. Finding ways of organizing my work promises to
be of great help now and in the future, as my writing (hopefully) continues
to improve.</P>

<P>#6. What should I do differently in the future in order to help students
to succeed?</P>

<P>My number one recommendation would be to help kids to come up with appropriate
overarching questions right from the very beginning. The overarching question
is essential to all research. If someone starts with an overarching question
that is too general, like mine, or too specific, they will have a very
difficult time in research. I highly recommend that you help them to come
up with good overarching questions and sub questions before any research
or writing begins. This makes the entire process go much more smoothly
and improves the quality of the finished product tremendously. Another
thing that I recommend is the mentorship. Relatively few people ever signed
up for the program, although it was educational, fun, and counts for four
fifths of all project points. The low participation could have been due
to the fact that many people did not have career choices that easily translated
into their inquiries. This brings up another point, that perhaps it would
be wise to encourage people to pursue inquiry topics in their planned areas
of future employment. Even if one does not wish to have the mentorship
work for English credit, it is still a very good idea to try it, and some
encouragement may prove beneficial. Another aid would be to bring the inquiry
closer to what we do in class. This may include more work time in class
or a greater explanation of the task at hand. The inquiry seemed very separate
from what we did in-class, as perhaps it was supposed to be, and the result
is the homework load for two classes, or more, from only one class. The
inquiry is such a huge project that more time in-class would be highly
beneficial. More student-teacher conferences, especially towards the beginning,
would also help the process. I had a very slow start, which handicapped
me throughout the project and made it just that much harder at the end.
Making sure that students are on course at the beginning of their voyage
ensures that they will able to reach their destinations without sailing
right off the edge of the earth (I think that means dropping out of the
class). More time for research may also be helpful. The time at IUPUI was
very beneficial, except that I did not yet know what I was researching.
Another problem I faced was the journals. They can prove very helpful if
they are actually done, but completely worthless if they are done after
the paper. The easiest way to solve this is to make journals due at the
end of the month, or perhaps a week after to alleviate the end-of-the-month
congestion. The current system of turning in one journal every six weeks
makes no sense, if we are supposed to have two months finished then we
should turn in two months. Otherwise some journals tend not to be done
all at the end, when they are of no help. The process of turning in papers
and getting them back the next day for revision was helpful, if not extremely
underutilized. One way to get papers in sooner would be to assign them
sooner, as soon as the previous papers come due. Many times details on
papers were not given until the middle of the month, which only left two
weeks for drafts and revisions. Allowing more time to write the paper should
allow them to come in earlier, thereby allowing for more revisions.</P>

<P>#7. What advice would you give to a student as he/she approaches the
inquiry?</P>

<P>Good luck! They want more advice? Good luck and have fun! Honestly,
I would advise a student to start early, finish everything before it is
due. I heard his exact same piece of advice when I started, and I knew
I would say it at the end, but it is very true. Getting papers in early
to have them revised makes for less stress around the deadline and a better
paper as well. Almost no additional time is required, only that the time
taken come earlier. The process becomes so much easier when the paper is
not put off until the end of the month, as I have come to find out. In
short, don’t procrastinate! I also recommend that the person finishes the
journals when they are due. They help in writing the papers because they
allow you to verbally organize your thoughts without being harshly graded
on them. The journals tell you what you need to think about and research
and what you already know. If they are not done before the papers then
they are only counterproductive, adding to the mountain of work instead
of easing it. I highly recommend that the students complete the journals
as they are written, they can only help. I also want to go on to say that
it is best if journals are typed. While it may be a little bit more inconvenient,
it makes it much easier and neater to insert the journals into the finished
inquiry. I would advise them to start on their project points as early
as possible, far earlier than we did. I especially recommend the six week
mentorship. If someone would rather do something like an Internet site
or a creative work, I still recommend that they get an early start, because
it helps to relieve that congestion near the end. Fellow inquiry writers,
don’t get behind. Be sure that you have your work done on time and that
you have done everything required or the end may seem quite daunting. Keeping
up is important, you can’t write a solution paper until you understand
your problem. This may seem obvious, but it is very important. Encourage
students to come to you if they feel that they are having problems, getting
behind, or just don’t understand an assignment. Scheduling individual conferences
should be very easy if someone needs the extra help. Offer help to people
who are obviously struggling, the earlier the better. Don’t allow anyone
to get behind or move onto the next paper if the last was no good. I highly
advise future inquirists to seek help when they feel that they need it.
Lastly, I want to encourage everyone to pay attention to the assignment
when they are told of the inquiry before summer vacation. It may be hard
to understand because everything is new, but the information and advice
may prove very helpful. The students who came in to talk to our class had
already been through the inquiry, so we should have asked more questions.
They are the ultimate source, take advantage of them before they go off
to college.</P>

<P>#8. Tell me any closing comments.</P>

<P>Because this will be the last page of my inquiry, I want to tell about
what this inquiry has done for me. I have learned a lot about my topic
and about myself. I have gained self esteem as I watch my project go from
concept to reality. I have learned about goals and time management, as
with many other skills that I can use throughout my life. I have always
loved computers, and the idea of doing an inquiry on them was intriguing.
Studying such a topic has been very interesting and educational. I have
learned more about the problem and solution than I thought I would ever
want to know. I have also learned a lot about myself through the project.
I must set goals for myself in order to achieve. I must be decisive in
order to get things done. I must never give up, just take each challenge
as it comes. I have discovered that setting goals is very important. Goals
give you something to shoot for, a challenge to be met. Setting goals for
myself allows me to test my limits and see what I can do. Goals also aid
in time management, as getting things in on time is important in all areas
of life. Using time effectively is very important, especially when my schedule
becomes even busier in college. Most importantly, I feel, is the sense
of satisfaction and self confidence that I have gained as I have watched
my work grow and develop. I know that I will feel an intense satisfaction
when I finish the final version and turn in my labors. This sense, along
with this book, will follow me for the rest of my life. Now that I have
finished the last page of my inquiry, it’s time to go back and write the
middle.</P>
