<P><B>I. Collection of Notes</B></P>

<UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take notes on all of the books I read, fiction, non-fiction and
others, as I read the book. These notes will be kept on 3Ó by 5Ó note cards.
Each card will include a reference number to indicate the book, the number
or description of the question they answer, a quote or summary from the
book, and some will also include a statement clarifying the meaning or
impact of the excerpt.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>II. Organization of Notes</B></P>

<UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the notes have been written on cards, they will arranged according
to the question or sub question which the specific statement regards. The
sub question will be divided by tabbed note cards containing a number or
summary of each question. Headings may include definition, history, effect,
and other topics.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>III. Management</B></P>

<UL>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the note cards and the tabbed heading cards will be filed into
a series of note card filing boxes. All of the boxes will be saved for
later use. This will provide easy access to notes for the writing of reports
and other papers.</P>
