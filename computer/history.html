<H1>Humble Beginnings</H1>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very first electronic computer in the world was
the ENIAC. The ENIAC was developed for the military in 1946 to help with
the calculation of ballistics problems (New 343). It filled a large room,
tipped the scales at more than 30 tons, and had over 18,000 tubes (Richman
45). This was the first computer that humans ever had access to, and very
limited access at that, so it marks the beginning of my problem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ENIAC was a first-generation computer. The invention
of the transistor in the late 1950s brought about the second generation
of computers, but these were still far out of the reach of consumers (Richman
47). Third generation computers, sporting the new integrated circuit, dropped
the price of computers even lower, but they were still limited to businesses.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The invention of the central processing unit, or CPU,
ushered in the fourth generation, which was the first to be bought by both
businesses and consumers. These computers were smaller, faster, and more
capable than their predecessors, not to mention the fact that their price
was down to four digits.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unveiling of the Apple II had a lot to do with
the modern problem of computer access. It was cutting edge and new, because
it was the first home computer, which also made it quite expensive. Many
people bought one, at least those who could afford it. The majority of
the public had still never used a computer, though. This was not a problem,
however, because a computer was more of a hobby than a tool. About this
same time, in the early 1980s, businesses started to buy computers too.
These early computers were extremely difficult to use, so a skilled operator
could make a lot of money. These computers were still fairly rare, so the
problem was not very large yet.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past two decades since the first modern computers
started to appear, the computer has become such an integral part of the
business world. Nearly all professions require at least some knowledge
of the computer. As time passes and technology continues to advance, the
problem will only become worse. More and more jobs will require employees
to know how to use a computer, putting those people with computer skills
in even higher demand. This trend translates to higher pay for those with
access to computers, and lower pay for those without it.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The specific causes of the problem may be difficult
to find. One of the causes is the lack of qualified computer educators
in the public school system. Public schools treat computers as a tool or
a new type of discipline, not as a different way of looking at and communicating
everything else. &quot;[Computers] are lined up in a spare room and used
for drill and practice in arithmetic and language arts, or as reward for
students who do their work quickly or well&quot; (Gooden xiv). There are
not enough instructors who know how to use the computer to supplement a
child's education instead of replace it. Our children are not being fully
educated on computers and how they are useful to us.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problems with our schools stem from the inner
machinery of our national government. The government has not made it a
priority to educate our youth about computers, and consequently there is
not adequate funding for computer labs in many schools. Combined with the
lack of instructors, the limited funding for computers means that our schools
have grossly inadequate computer facilities. The education system also
acts as a stumbling block because it does not allow for computers to be
integrated in to the curriculum, but rather a curriculum all by themselves.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major cause of the problem is the inavailability
of computers to those who can not afford to buy them. Only a very limited
number of computers are available to the general public, and these computers
are generally for a very specific function. For instance, the Hussey-Mayfield
Public Library has many computers available to the public for research
and book catalogs, but only two computers for the internet and only one
for typing. This would not be enough for another community in which few
have a computer at home, let alone the skills to use one. The government
must step in to ensure fair access to computers for all Americans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem is mainly due to the high cost of computers.
Today's computers are faster and better, which means a higher cost. Less
expensive computers or television internet connections may provide an adequate
solution, but a free or extremely low cost alternative must be found.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another cause is the lack of computer classes for
adults. Children receive free education on computers, but there is no such
alternative for adults. An adult who has never used a computer would have
trouble learning how to use one, especially if he or she has no access
to a modern computer. Few classes or courses exist, and those that do can
cost between $170 and $375 per day (Weaver 7). More public classes need
to be offered to encourage all to learn basic computer skills.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most obvious of the causes is the inavailability
of computers to the poor. This is the basis of the whole issue, and a fix
for this cause would almost entirely eliminate the problem. This cause
is also the most measurable. About 80% of homes with more than $100,000
in income had computers, whereas only 25% of those with $30,000 or less
in income had computers in the home (Nearly 16). The evidence speaks for
itself, there is a problem.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem of unequal access to computers is not
a new problem. There have always been 'haves' and 'have-nots' in society,
but only since the invention of the computer has the problem manifested
itself in this area. The causes are numerous, but the benefits of finding
a suitable solution are also extensive. Finding a solution that meets the
requirements of each cause ensures a solution that will be effective and
help our entire society.</P>
