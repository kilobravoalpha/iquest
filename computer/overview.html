<P><BR>
</P>

<P>How might we provide fair access to computers for all members of our
society?</P>

<P><BR>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="sub"></A>Sub Questions</H2>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>1. What is computer technology?</P>

<P>2. What roles do computers play in our society?</P>

<P>3. Why do people require access to computers?</P>

<P>4. How has computer technology become more prevalent in our current
society than in the past?</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society?</P>

<P>6. In what ways might computer-related technologies affect our future?</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally or
some more than others?</P>

<H2><A NAME="problem"></A>Problem &amp; Solution</H2>

<P><BR>
</P>

<P>Computers have an incredible power to calculate, which makes them very
useful to us. This power allows us to do more things and do them faster
and better, but only if we have access to a computer. Those who cannot
afford a computer or don't know how to use one are disadvantaged in our
society. Computer skills can mean the difference between finding employment
and finding only dead ends, as computer skills are so crucial in today's
workplace.</P>

<P>Only by providing access to everyone can we remedy the problem. The
simplest and most effective method for doing this is to establish a local
computer center to serve the computing need of those members of the community
who would otherwise have no access. This would be easily accomplished by
putting a staff into a school or library computer room, with little overhead
cost because the computers have already been paid for by the taxpayers.
Such a solution serves to educate the public about computers as well as
training them on how to use a computer.</P>
