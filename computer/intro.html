<H1>Our Future, Part I</H1>

<P><BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our country was founded, our economy was pre-industrial.
Each person worked independently, with almost no specialization in the
work force. Crops had to be grown and clothes had to be sewn. This was
a simple approach to life and the economy, but it would not last.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Industrial Revolution began in Europe. Its
ideas spread to America, where they took hold. Factories began to dot the
landscape as steam power became more readily available. Instead of being
self-sufficient and making everything they needed, citizens were being
employed in jobs where they performed very specific labor. No longer was
it every man for himself, now we had to work together.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Industrial Revolution also caused profound changes
in our culture. Our specialization meant the end of the bartering system,
so we developed a monetary system. We then worked to earn money, instead
of making only what we need. Because we could now buy food with the money
that we had earned, there was no need to live on a farm. Cities became
very popular as both factories and workers could be found in the same spot.
Mass production was developed, and the price of the stuff we need dropped
as the quality rose. In short, the Industrial Revolution changed everything
from what and how we work to where we live.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shortly after World War II, our civilization started
to progress again. We began to move from an industrial society to a post-industrial
society. While industry and manufacturing are still very common, the economy
is shifting towards the business of information processing. We see more
and more office buildings being erected, each containing room for hundreds
or thousands of cubicles and offices. Each of these offices has a desk
and on the corner of each desk is a computer. In fact, the single most
important invention that has made this post-industrial revolution possible
is the computer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing from history how the Industrial Revolution
changed people's lives we can only imagine the consequences of the post-industrial
revolution. Our monetary system is already changing, and paper money seems
to be on its way to extinction. We will no longer be confined to cities,
or even to this planet. The globe is growing smaller daily as technology
removes the barriers between every country and culture. The computer will
change our lives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scenario makes one assumption, however. In order
to progress our civilization to the next level, we must all do it together.
Those who do not have access to the information vital to the coming age
will simply be left behind, without a second thought. We must all move
together into the next millennia, we must all work together to write the
next chapter in the history of America.</P>
