<H1>Digital Segregation</H1>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our age of technology has brought us many advantages:
first the telephone, then the television, and now the computer. The new
technology has the potential to help us immensely in our daily lives. We
can access our money from a computerized ATM anywhere in the world. We
can use the Internet to research a topic in a library in Germany. We can
use e-mail to tell our senator what we think or to find out how he voted
on a bill that may affect our job. In short, we all rely on computers in
many functions of our daily lives. We require access to computers in order
to do our banking, our homework, and even to participate in our government.
&quot;Access to the information highway may determine the basic ability
to function in a democratic culture&quot; (Ratan 25). But this access is
not available to all of the members of our society. &quot;Technology, despite
its potential to level the social landscape, is not yet blind to race,
age or wealth&quot; (Hancock 51). Some of the hardest hit groups include
racial minority groups, low-income citizens, and children who need the
knowledge most. &quot;Computers are still clearly beyond the means of most...
low-income citizens, and will be for many years, even if prices decline
significantly&quot; (Chapman 48).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A major problem that arises with the lack of computer
knowledge is unequal employment in the workplace. Today's businesses rely
on computers and people who know how to use them. &quot;To have an edge
in America's job search... it's critical to be digital&quot; (Hancock 50).
This inequity in employment has only served to widen the gap between the
rich and poor in our society. In a poll taken in 1995, 23% of people said
that computers are dividing the rich and poor, though 58% say the gap is
so large that computers make no difference (Hancock 52). This gap comes
from the difference in wages between employees who can use a computer and
those who cannot. &quot;A working person who is able to use a computer
earns 15% more than someone in a similar job who cannot&quot; (Ratan 25).
Economists attribute this difference to the law of supply and demand. &quot;As
computers have spread, the demand for workers who can use them has increased.
Wages for those workers rise, while wages for the unskilled (who can't
use them) fall&quot; (Samuelson 55).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer skills are a necessity in the job market,
and yet many of our citizens do not have such skills. Their inability to
gain access to a computer is the major factor in their lack of computer
knowledge. Among households with annual incomes exceeding $75,000 per year,
74% have a computer at home, whereas only 15% of families with incomes
under $20,000 own a computer (Hancock 50). Charles Clark states that families
with an income of $50,000 or more are 10 times more likely than others
to have access to the Internet (Leone 118). The process is cyclical, as
many low-income citizens don't own a computer because they can't afford
it, they can't use a computer because they have no access to one, and can't
afford a computer because they make less money than the person who knows
how to use one.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marilee Colon, a fifth grader from South Boston, has
only limited access to computers. She is growing up in a poor neighborhood
and her public school has no computers. She and her mom have computers
available at the United South End Settlement Center, but they are terribly
outdated and are not capable of connecting to the Internet. With her limited
experience with computers, Marilee faces an uncertain future. She will
not have the same opportunities for future employment because nearly every
occupation will require some amount of computer experience. &quot;Nearly
every American business from Wall Street to McDonald's requires some computer
knowledge&quot; (Hancock 50).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the forces helping to perpetuate this problem
is our government. The federal government has not made it a priority to
put computers into classrooms, and hence there is no funding for such a
project. &quot;Some successful projects have relied heavily on the kindness
of strangers&quot; (Hancock 52). One of the major problems is the high
cost of new computers. The pace of technology moves so quickly that &quot;it's
hard for cash-strapped municipalities to catch up.&quot; (Hancock 51).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another problem that the government helps to perpetuate
is setting aside funding for computers for schools, but not for adults.
Nicholas Negroponte, a computer expert from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, states that &quot;adults are the true digitally homeless,
the needy&quot; (Hancock 53). Teaching computer skills in grade school
and high school does give children a good base in the high-tech world,
but it does not go far enough. Technology advances so quickly that once
someone leaves school, he or she needs occasional access to computers just
to keep up with new technology. Only four years ago the computer programming
classes at our middle school used Apple II computers, which are obsolete
today. The skills we learned then are of no value on today's Windows machines
or on the Internet. If no one had been given access to newer and better
computers, the Internet would be just as foreign to us as the Apple II
would have been to the generation before us. The government must also invest
in adult computer education so that everyone has equal opportunities to
keep current on how to use the latest technology.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our technology can do great things for us, it
can also hurt us. Economists believe that &quot;the swift pace of high-tech
advances will only drive a further wedge between the [rich and poor]&quot;
(Hancock 50). To prevent this gloomy situation, our society must encourage
computer literacy for everyone. The government needs to set up a program
to give access to all, young and old, rich and poor. Computers are tools
that should not be limited only to those who can afford them, but should
be available to all. The risks of digital segregation are numerous and
none of them are helpful to society. Changes in the current system would
allow us all to work more effectively while leveling the socioeconomic
divide between us.</P>
