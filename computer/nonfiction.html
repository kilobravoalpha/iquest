<P><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P>Negroponte, Nicholas. <U>Being Digital.</U> New York: Alfred A. Knopf,
1995.</P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>Mr. Negroponte goes into depth to describe technology and what it will
do for our society. He uses metaphors to help explain even complicated
concepts, and he does an excellent job of showing how changes will affect
us all. The book discusses the difference between digital media and traditional
media, how we interact with computers, and our &quot;digital life&quot;.</P>

<P><B>Sub Question Analysis</B></P>

<P>1. What is computer technology? The author does not use the term 'computer'
because it represents an inconvenient machine, whereas a 'digital appliance'
could be anything from a wristwatch to a television. The author describes
a bit, or the most basic element of digital communication, by saying that
&quot;A bit has no color, size, or weight, and it can travel at the speed
of light. It is the smallest atomic element in the DNA of information.
It is a state of being on or off, up or down, black or white. For practical
purposes we consider a bit to be a 1 or a 0&quot; (14).</P>

<P>2. What role do computers play in our society? Whether we know it or
not, computers will greatly affect our future. However, they do not play
nearly as big of a role today as they will in the future. Their role is
and will increasingly be to provide us with information. These 'information
appliances' will not necessarily look like the computers of today, but
will rather act as a kind of digital guide.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of computer technology pose a threat to our
society? The author discusses the negative effects that overuse of technology
could have on our society. For instance, if a person relies on a machine
to do all of their research, they will not know how to do the work for
themselves. We may also face problems in the transition from atoms (books,
newspapers, etc.) to bits (multimedia). The social consequences could be
just as great as those of the invention of the printing press.</P>

<P>4. How has computer technology become more prevalent in our current
society than in the past? As our technology continues to advance, computers
find more and more homes in the most unexpected of places. For instance,
the average 1995 car has 50 microprocessors built-in. We rely on computers
and other digital technologies much more now than we have in the past.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? Computers have greatly
affected the way we do research. Now we use card catalogs on the computer,
magazine databases, and even the internet to conduct our research. They
have allowed us to do more creatively, letting us use our full imaginations.
The author states &quot;being digital is the option to be independent of
confining standards&quot; (44). Negroponte also says &quot;man is beginning
to do business in bits instead of atoms&quot; (13), referring to the switch
from 'atoms' to 'bits'.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might computer-related technologies affect our future?
The author says that &quot;the digital world will look and feel like the
head of a pin&quot; (6). New digital technologies will allow us unimaginable
freedoms and change the way we look at information. For instance, &quot;being
digital will change the nature of mass media from a process of pushing
bits at people to one of allowing people (or their computers) to pull at
them&quot; (84).</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally of
some more than others The division of those who embrace digital technologies
and those who shun it occurs mainly along generational lines. For instance,
while 35% of American families have computers in their home, 50% of teenagers
have them (5). Children are raised with the technology and take it for
granted, while adults must learn to embrace the technology into their daily
lives.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing computer technology?
According to the author, we are not enhancing our technology so much as
letting it evolve. &quot;The change from atoms to bits is irrevocable and
unstoppable&quot; (4). He uses the example of a newspaper, noting that
&quot;the entire conception and construction of a newspaper is digital,
from beginning to end, until the very last step, when ink is squeezed onto
dead trees. This is the step where bits become atoms&quot; (56). This describes
how the entire process has become digital in order to make the process
simpler and easier.</P>

<P>9. How are computers both helpful and harmful to our society? As stated
above, digital technologies have allowed us to do more with less. It makes
television signals clearer and at the same time helps us be more creative.
However, too much information could make our lives needlessly complicated,
as too much of anything is never a good thing.</P>

<P>10. How have computers changed our culture? &quot;Computing is not about
computing anymore. It is about living&quot; (6). Computers are becoming
ingrained into our society, and they will soon become an essential part
of our life. They will also change our values towards using digital means
as our primary source of information and entertainment. &quot;As we interconnect
ourselves, many of the values of a nation-state will give way to those
of both larger and smaller electronic communities&quot; (7).</P>

<P><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P>Bailey, James. <U>After Thought: The Computer Challenge to Human Intelligence.</U>
New York: HarperCollins, 1996.</P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>Mr. Bailey's intent in this book is to show how computers will change
the process of thinking. He explains that people think sequentially, processing
information one piece at a time. Computers process information by sorting
through millions of tiny operations and analyzing problems all at once.
The majority of the book describes the consequences of this shift in thinking.</P>

<P><B>Sub Question Analysis</B></P>

<P>1. What is computer technology? The author never clearly defines what
a 'computer' is, but his usage in context indicates that he is referring
to a machine that processes information using digital means. In other words,
any digital appliance is a computer. This means that a computer could be
anything from a wristwatch to a supercomputer, which makes the problem
very far-reaching.</P>

<P>2. What role do computers play in our society? Mr. Bailey does not talk
about how computers affect us today so much as how they will affect us
tomorrow. He says that today's computers think mainly like we do, they
are programmed to think sequentially. As computers evolve, however, this
will change.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of computer technology pose a threat to our
society? On this point, the author points out that computers are very different
from humans. He states &quot;Electronic circuits really are alien. Human
minds and electronic circuits provide completely different milieus within
which to carry out information-processing tasks.&quot; This further emphasizes
his point that computers will not take over the thought processes of humans,
but rather invent their own thought processes.</P>

<P>4. How has computer technology become more prevalent in our current
society than in the past? To emphasize this point, the author makes an
excellent comparison of our life with Thoreau's life. He said &quot;While
Thoreau was at Walden making detailed records of the plants and animals
of the surrounding woods and listening for the whistle of the steam engine
across the pond, the Englishman Charles Babbage was designing a very different
kind of engine, an Analytical Engine [mechanical computer] that would reassign
the tasks of computing numerical tables from human minds to machines.&quot;
He tells of the transition to today's computers.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? One of the things
that computers will change is the way we teach math in our schools. The
author believes that &quot;At a minimum, it is time to transfer responsibility
for teaching geometry to the history department. If students should be
introduces to the maths of the ancient Greeks, it should be in the same
way they are introduced to the political theories and art of the Greeks&quot;
(9). This will allow room in the math departments to teach the new intermaths,
which are closer to the type of maths that computers will use.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might computer-related technologies affect our future?
Mr. Bailey says that in the future specialists will only be able to ask
a computer for advice on vital issues. They will play no part in finding
the solution as they do today. &quot;Not even specialists will know how
these answers came about, because the ways of bit evolution will not be
our ways&quot; (7). If this is the case, we do not know if humans will
remain dominant over the computers or if the computers could possibly take
over.</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally of
some more than others? If computer technology were to affect the way we
are taught, or in fact the way we think, it would obviously affect us all
drastically. However, because older generations usually have a harder time
adapting to change, they might not have as drastic an effect.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing computer technology?
The author sees the development of technology as a form of evolution. Computer
programs are being allowed to evolve by themselves, to learn for themselves.
By this method, computers are developing entirely new ways of thinking
that are free from human programming. By this theory, we do not enhance
the computers, rather they enhance themselves.</P>

<P>9. How are computers both helpful and harmful to our society? The process
of developing a new way of thinking can be a scarry prospect. While it
certainly promises to advance our society, it can not do so without making
serious changes as well. It remains to be seen whether these changes will
help us more than they hurt us.</P>

<P>10. How have computers changed our culture? Mr. Bailey says that the
computer evolution is one of the causes for our cultural evolution. In
the past, a culture has only been able to change so fast, and today that
limit is being strained. &quot;Our culture is producing information faster
then our processes of thought can absorb it and understand it.&quot; The
effects of this strain are unknown, but they are causing our culture to
evolve at a pace more rapid than ever before.</P>

<P><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P>Iovine, John. <U>Robots, Androids, and Animatrons.</U> New York: McGraw-Hill,
1998.</P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>In this book, the author goes into how and why robots have been developed.
He discusses concepts like artificial intelligence and how computer thought
differs from human thought. He explains neural nets, which are the closest
technology we have to mimicking the human brain. The remainder of the book
contains various robots that you can build on you own.</P>

<P><B>Sub Question Analysis</B></P>

<P>1. What is computer technology? Mr. Iovine takes a radically different
view on computer technology. He refers to everything from a simple neural
network to a complex supercomputer. He defines a neural network as a network
of stimuli responses that cause various responses. A robot might use these
to generate a certain behavior based on its stimuli, or inputs. The networks
might be as tiny as only a few components or as large as can be imagined.
Each of these is a type of computer technology.</P>

<P>2. What role do computers play in our society? Computers and robots
are already used quite extensively in our society. For instance, NASA's
new programs for space exploration all use robots instead of humans. This
is because &quot;it's much cheaper to send an expendable robot than a human&quot;
(3). They are also used in many industrial situations because robots excel
at repetitive and precise motions, such as welding car bodies or placing
components onto a circuit board. A robot is also much cheaper to operate
than a man.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of computer technology pose a threat to our
society? One threat from this new technology is that once Artificial Intelligence
begins to evolve, we cannot stop it. &quot;[Artificial intelligence] is
an evolving, uncompromising, unrelenting reality&quot; (18). Computer intelligence
may someday surpass human intelligence, and what might happen after that
is a mystery.</P>

<P>4. How has computer technology become more prevalent in our current
society than in the past? The first popular robot was Elektro the Moto
Man, who was presented at the 1939 Worlds' Fair (2). He had no purpose
and couldn't conduct any useful tasks. As the technology behind computers
and robots steadily increased, the idea became more feasible. &quot;The
first generation of computers was a billion times clumsier and less efficient
than the human brain. Today, the gap has narrowed a thousandfold&quot;
(18). The technology has evolved and become much smarter, and has become
more commonplace as a result.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? Computers have made
our society more productive. Computer controlled robots can do more work
in less time, and with far greater accuracy and less cost than a human.
Due to their cost-effectiveness, they will continue to replace human jobs.
While this may yield higher quality products at a lower price, it may also
mean that some workers will have to be laid off as their jobs are taken
over.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might computer-related technologies affect our future?
Robotics will continue to evolve as the technology they are based on is
improved. &quot;Like biological systems, robotics is evolving following
the Darwinian model of survival of the fittest&quot; (xvii). The best technologies
will survive, while the others will die off. Although we do know that computers
will continue to evolve far into the future, we do not know exactly how
they will evolve and what they might evolve into. &quot;No one can be sure
which method or technology will be used 100 years from now&quot; (xvii).</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally of
some more than others? The author does not speculate on whether the technology
will affect us all equally, but only says that the new technologies will
have a drastic effect on us all.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing computer technology?
The reason that we try to develop new technology is simple, because we
always want to be the best. Our government is trying to develop a machine
with superior artificial intelligence because such a machine could be set
to work on &quot;the national economy, pollution, military strategy, medical
and scientific strategy, and, of course, designing still smarter machines&quot;
(19). The way to achieve these superior capabilities is through machines
that are actually conscious. The author explains how machines can have
a conscience by saying that &quot;consciousness is a manifestation of the
brain's internal thought processes. The evolution of consciousness coincides
with the evolution and development of neural structures (the brain) in
biological systems&quot; (15-16). Today's supercomputers have approximately
the same consciousness of a worm. If a worm can be said to have a conscience,
then so to can a computer. Development of such advanced computers will
someday help to advance our society.</P>

<P>9. How are computers both helpful and harmful to our society? One example
of how such technology can be both helpful and harmful is that of robotics
in the industrial world. These robots would speed up the operations and
cut costs, but them might also take jobs away from humans. In these regards
they are both a help and a hindrance, and our society will need to establish
a line to prevent them from becoming too much of a hindrance.</P>

<P>10. How have computers changed our culture? Because the science of robotics
is still in its infancy, it has not yet had a drastic effect on our culture.
As it matures, however, and begins to take its place in our world, the
changes it will make in our culture will be permanent.</P>

<P><BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
</P>
<P>Postman, Neil. <U>Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology.</U>
New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1993.</P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>In his book, Neil Postman describes the various ways in which computers
will inevitably change our lives as well as our culture. Throughout his
work, Mr. Postman compares our faith in technology to the belief people
used to have in religion. He emphasizes the problems of relying too heavily
on computers and what they have done, and will continue to do, to our culture.</P>

<P><B>Sub-question Analysis</B></P>

<P>1. What is digital technology? The author uses the term computer to
mean any of the various digital technologies. He shows the potential of
the computer by saying "everyone uses or is used by computers, and for
purposes that seem to know no boundaries" (108). He is not referring to
a computer solely as a large box that sits on one's desk, but rather any
form of digital circuitry. He further describes the universality of computers
as "infinitely various" (107) and "commonly integrated into other machines"
(107).</P>

<P>2. What roles do computers play in our society? In today's society,
computers are commonly all about us, and we are often completely unaware
of their use. As computers continually increase in speed and 'brain power',
they also take an ever-increasing role in our society. The author quotes
Marvin Minsky as saying "if we are lucky, [computers] will keep us as pets"(111),
because their 'brains' will be much more capable than ours.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of digital technology pose a threat to our society?
Because of its superior 'brain power', the computer will cause many conflicts
in society. For instance, people have begun to use their computers to make
decisions for them, without taking responsibility for the outcome. "[Technology]
subordinates the claims of our nature, our biology, our emotions, our spirituality.
The computer claims sovereignty over the whole range of human experience,
and supports its claim by showing that it 'thinks' better than we can"
(111). The author goes on to speak of how technology today represents the
supreme authority that religion once did many years ago. "We have devalued
the singular human capacity to see things whole in all their psychic, emotional,
and moral dimensions, and we have replaced this with faith in the powers
of technical calculation" (118). This reliance and complete trust in the
power of computers is degrading to society.</P>

<P>4. How has digital technology become more prevalent in our current society
than in the past? The author traces the history of intelligence in computers
as they evolved. The test for intelligence, as developed by Alan Turing,
is simply the ability of a machine corresponding with a human to deceive
the human into thinking that he is talking to another human. The first
program to pass this test was called Eliza, which imitated a psychologist
by asking short questions and collecting information for new questions
(110). As computers continue to evolve, they will be able to do more and
more thinking and will seem to become more intelligent.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? Mr. Postman emphasizes
the fact that computers are having, and will continue to have, a great
impact on our society. They have changed the way we think, in that humans
have now been able to assign numbers to everything to measure it (i.e.
grading scales, human emotions). They change the way we act because we
place more emphasis on what they say. We listen to them instead of ourselves,
thereby putting computers in control of our society.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might digital technologies affect our future? As the
technology evolves, computers will only become smarter and faster. Because
we see them as 'smarter', we trust them to make decisions for us. This
practice is not a beneficial one, however, in that a computer cannot possibly
weigh all of the options and undergo creative problem solving like the
human mind can. This trend will lead to negative consequences in the future,
and may someday make computers dominant over the human race that created
them.</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally or
some more that others? Simply stated, the author believes that "the benefits
and deficits of a new technology are not distributed equally. There are...
winners and losers" (9). He further explains that "those who cultivate
competence in the use of a new technology become an elite group that are
granted undeserved authority and prestige by those who have no such competence"
(9). In other words, the winners in the game of technology separate themselves
from the losers, creating a huge gap between the two. He goes on to discuss
how the winners will use the technology against the losers, by tracking
them and controlling them. He hypothesizes that those who have access to
the knowledge created by the technology will "inevitably form a kind of
conspiracy against" (9) those who do not.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing digital technology?
Though our society continues to attempt to find faster and more intelligent
computers, we are doing so without knowing why. Despite our attempts to
develop artificial intelligence in computers, according to Mr. Postman
this goal can never be achieved. "Although the quest for a machine that
duplicates mind has ancient roots, and although digital logic circuitry
has given that quest a scientific structure, artificial intelligence does
not and cannot lead to a meaning-making, understanding, and feeling creature,
which is what a human being is" (113). This idea is stated more simply
as "machines cannot feel and, just as important, cannot understand" (112).
The goal of developing an 'intelligent' machine is unrealistic because
digital circuits can never truly understand.</P>

<P>9. How are digital technologies both helpful and harmful? The author
makes it very clear that there are actually two sides to technology, both
a good side and a bad side. On one hand, "technology is a friend. It makes
life easier, cleaner, and longer. Can anyone ask more of a friend?" (xii).
While technology does make life better, it also has several negative consequences.
"[Technology's] gifts are not without a heavy cost... the accusation can
be made that the uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital sources
of humanity" (xii). Technology is both a friend and a foe of mankind.</P>

<P>10. How have digital technologies changed our culture? Computers have
made a significant impact on our culture, and not all of it is positive.
We have begun to allow computers to make decisions in our lives. Because
the computer cannot understand a problem or its solution, this practice
will not always yield the best solution. Our culture has also adopted a
belief in scientism. If the scientists say it is true, than we believe
them. We believe that computers are always right and that it is we who
are wrong. This belief is not realistic, because computers are not 'intelligent'
like humans and are not capable of the same decision-making powers. </P>
