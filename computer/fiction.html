<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>Simtec, a large personal computer manufacturer, one day sends thousands
of computers to the wrong address. It is discovered that a man has gotten
illegal access to the Simtec computer network and had been able to change
files. He asks for $1 million in order to stop his attack, but Simtec refuses.
Hektor, the attacker, continues his assault and continues to raise his
price, but Simtec will not pay. Finally, as their stock begins to fall
and the crisis affects over 400,000 computers, Simtec is forced to give
in and pay $10 million. Only after this money is paid do they realize that
it was an executive inside the company who has been supplying all the information
to their attacker.</P>

<P><B>List of Characters:</B></P>

<P>Barry Shepard-The main character and narrator, Barry is a manager in
charge of Simtec's customer support. Barry becomes very involved in the
crisis, and he is the one who makes many of the discoveries along the way,
as well as the final discovery that Jim Seidler was actually the leak.
Barry is devoted to his work, but he is also a family man with an eight
year old daughter.</P>

<P>Jim Seidler-Years ago, when Simtec had hired a new president from outside
the company, it had been Jim who was up for the job. Now Jim was sabotaging
the company in order to make their current president look bad. He thought
that the Board of Directors would then vote her out and make him the president,
which they did until Barry discovered that Jim was the outside leak.</P>

<P>Pat DuPree (alias Pat Draper, Hektor)-Pat was bored with his 9 to 5
job so he left and began to attack corporations through their computer
network and holding them for ransom. He had been working his way up through
the years, and Simtec was to be his crowning glory. He became too greedy
and was eventually killed by an unknown group.</P>

<P>William H. Dunn-The head of Security Associates, Will had been hired
after the first network attack to help secure Simtec's computer network.
He worked very closely with Barry in the beginning until he found out too
much and one of Hektor's men run him down with a car. Even from his hospital
bed he worked hard to help get to the bottom of the mystery.</P>

<P>Diane Hughes-The president of Simtec, Diane took much of the blame until
Jim was found guilty. It was believed that she had started the crisis in
order to get the company all stirred up and make some personnel changes
while things were in chaos. This would then help her to solidify her position
as president. Even at the end, we are not truly sure if she was involved.</P>

<P><B>Sub Question Analysis:</B></P>

<P>1. What is computer technology? While the book does not clearly define
computer technology, it deals with computer networks and personal computers.
Computer technology could be defined as the different types of computers
and servers that were dealt with in the book.</P>

<P>2. What role do computers play in our society? Within the company, computers
were widely used for all branches of the company, including marketing,
technical support, design, management, and so on. When the computers in
the company fail, the work simply grinds to a halt. The computers are so
heavily relied on at Simtec, as they are at other companies, that trying
to do work without a computer becomes impossible. Computers are vital to
our businesses and industries and provide an irreplaceable tool to workers.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of computer technology pose a threat to our
society? As mentioned, computers are today a vital tool in many businesses.
The threat comes in that we rely on them so much that a failure could mean
disaster. If a corporate network is brought to a halt, there is an immediate
threat to the company because they become unable to get anything done.
As the technology advances we rely on it more and more, and we become gradually
more vulnerable.</P>

<P>4. How has computer technology become more prevalent in our current
society than in the past? Computer technologies continue to improve and
as they improve, they are able to do more and more for us. Because they
can do more, we rely on them more. At Simtec, when they were able to create
a computer network, it dramatically sped up the production and shipping
of computers. This led to the widespread use of computers thought the company.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? In this book, computers
are vital to our society as well as our economy. They are a type of tool
that helps us accomplish work. They allow us to get things done faster,
better, and cheaper. Our society has grown close to computers to the point
that we rely on them to do any type of business.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might computer-related technologies affect our future?
The future will probably hold more of the same. Computers will evolve even
further to make our computers look archaic. Increasingly more human task
will be preformed by computers, and we will rely on them even more than
we do now. If events continue as they have in the past, we may begin to
rely on computers too much and that could end up hurting us.</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally of
some more than others? As technology continues to advance and find new
homes in the workplace, many of the people are affected equally. No matter
their task, from the mailroom to the boardroom, a computer will help to
make their job faster and easier. The development of computers did not
simply help one group of computers while hurting another, but rather advance
all people to be able to do more.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing computer technology?
As computers become more capable, they are able to do more for us. They
enhance our productivity and help us to yield better and more creative
work. As long as we continue to benefit from more advanced computers, the
computers will continue to advance.</P>

<P>9. How are computers both helpful and harmful to our society? Computers
are helpful because they allow us to do more. It is a tool which allows
us to work faster, more efficiently, with more creativity, and with better
results. On the other hand, it is these same points that cause them to
be harmful. As computers become better and we become better with them,
we rely on them more and more. If something were to happen to our computers,
just like Simtec, we would be at a loss. Because computers are so helpful
to mankind they are also dangerous to mankind.</P>

<P>10. How have computers changed our culture? While the book does not
go into detail about how computers have affected our culture, it is obvious
they have had a large effect on us. They have allowed us to do more with
less, which has changed us all. </P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>The book opens when a group of primitive men have been exposed to a
crystal which was sent from another world to probe the ancient men. The
book then moves to the present day, around 2001. A small monolith is found
on the moon and it sends a homing signal back to Saturn when it is discovered.
Hoping to uncover the destination of the signal, a mission is made to explore
the moons of Saturn. It is on this mission that Hal, a supercomputer, attempts
to take over the ship by killing its crew. One member survives and he completes
the mission by traveling through a SpacePort to another universe.</P>

<P><B>List of Characters</B></P>

<P>Moon-Watcher-In the early chapters of the book, Moon-Watcher is an early
man-ape that, like the rest of his society, simply goes about his daily
routine until the crystal changes him. It gives him a slight dissatisfaction
with life, and this emotion was what eventually led to our society as we
know it.</P>

<P>Haywoode Floyd-Haywoode is the specialist who is first sent to the moon
to investigate the monolith. When he hears the homing signal and realizes
that it is an alien creation, he arranges the space flight to Saturn to
look for the source.</P>

<P>David Bowman-David was the astronaut who was sent out on the probe to
Saturn. He had been an astronaut for many years and was quite experienced
in space travel. When Hal tried to kill its crew, David was the only one
to survive. He was then able to continue the mission to Saturn and eventually
found the SpacePort.</P>

<P>Hal-The HAL (Heuristically programmed ALogorythmic computer) 9000, or
Hal, was a supercomputer who provided the brains for the flight to Saturn.
When Hal became confused between the truth and a lie, it sought to rid
itself of the organic life forms that caused its problems. David survived
and was forced to destroy Hal's memory and effectively kill it.</P>

<P><B>Sub Question Analysis</B></P>

<P>1. What is computer technology? This book presents a broad definition
for computer technology, with devices ranging from the HAL supercomputer
to the Newspad, which was a digital version of a newspaper. Computer technology
is all-encompassing, as computers are everywhere throughout the book.</P>

<P>2. What role do computers play in our society? In the society of the
book, and especially on the ship, computers play an extremely large role.
When the HAL computer goes bad on the flight to Saturn, it is able to destroy
its crew. Hal was actually controlling the ship and it was very difficult
for David to maintain control after Hal was destroyed. The society relied
too heavily on their computer technology and found it difficult to function
when the technology was no longer available.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of computer technology pose a threat to our
society? As we become increasingly reliant upon computers in our daily
life, we are also creating a situation in which it will be hard to function
without them. We also run the risk of the technology trying to conquer
its creator, as we saw with Hal. Future computers might see the thoughts
and emotions of organic life &quot;as a hideous disease&quot; (v), and
would therefore attempt to destroy it.</P>

<P>4. How has computer technology become more prevalent in our current
society than in the past? Clarke shows the beginning of our fascination
with technology over 3 million years ago when &quot;Moon-Watcher felt the
first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion. It was a vague and diffuse
sense of envy&shy;of dissatisfaction with life. He had no idea of its cause,
still less of its cure; but discontent had come into his soul, and he had
taken one small step toward humanity&quot; (25). In this excerpt, Clarke
shows this dissatisfaction as the primary motivation to our drive toward
humanity. Computers were developed because of our desire for better things
in life.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? In the society within
the book, the technology helped to advance the society by allowing them
to explore. The early cavemen use technology such as sticks and stones
to hunt for larger game and to spread out around the world. In much the
same way, we can use computers to explore our environment, including spreading
into the far reaches of space while searching for alien life.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might computer-related technologies affect our future?
Clarke emphasizes that the kinds of technology we will have in the future
are unimaginable to us. Floyd, while contemplating his Newspad, thinks
&quot;it would pass away, to be replaced by something as unimaginable as
the Newspad itself would be to Caxton or Gutenberg&quot; (58). He is saying
that we can not know how such technologies will affect our future because
we can not possibly imagine such technologies. We can't see into the future.</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally of
some more than others? The topic of equality is not evident within the
book. Clarke does seem to have equal access to technologies like the Newspad,
while the HAL 9000 is limited to only a select few.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing computer technology?
Computers allow us to do more, and we always have the urge to do more.
We improve our computer technology to explore farther, work more efficiently,
and understand more. The computer technologies allow us to accomplish tasks
that could not be accomplished otherwise.</P>

<P>9. How are computers both helpful and harmful to our society? While
computer allow us to do more and go farther, they also make us more dependent.
We must rely on the technology in order for it to benefit us, and by relying
on it we are only drawing ourselves into a deeper hole. Computers help
and harm us at the same time, and it becomes extremely difficult to draw
a line between the two.</P>

<P>10. How have computers changed our culture? Our technology has a great
effect on the way we think and act. Clarke describes the evolution of man
once he has acquired the ability to use tools to hunt and live by simply
stating that &quot;the tool makers had been remade by their own tools&quot;
(36). This is as much true for our society as it was for the ancients.
As we continue to develop our computer technology, we also expand our boundaries
of knowledge and thought. Computers are a tool, and they will remake us
much like the first weapons remade early man.</P>

</P>
<P>Bronson, Po. <U>The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest: A Silicone
Valley Novel.</U> New York: Random House, 1997.</P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>Andy Caspar leaves a corporate computer firm and begins a job at a research
center. He is forced to work on a low-priority project, building a $300
computer, or VWPC. The chairman of the board, when he learns of the project,
cuts it because it will cut into his profits. Caspar refuses to abandon
the project, so he and his team leave and form their own company. After
a lot of hard work, the computer is a success.</P>

<P><B>List of Characters</B></P>

<P>Andy Caspar-The main character and leader of the team to develop the
$300 computer, Andy is an idealist who knows how to make his dreams come
true. When the company denies funding, he has the confidence to leave and
start his own company. He is also an excellent leader and is able to convince
the others to follow him in leaving the company.</P>

<P>Hank Menzinger-Hank truly embodies the Silicone Valley personality.
He has very high morals and values the power of the mind above all else.
However, he is not immune to corporate America and must eventually yield
to the pressure to cancel the $300 computer.</P>

<P>&quot;Tiny&quot; Curtis Reese-Tiny was one of the members of Andy's
team. He was very quiet and introspective, but he was also very intelligent
and valued his own mind. He was the ideal worker because he listened to
his leader and also was able to think for himself.</P>

<P><B>Sub Question Analysis</B></P>

<P>3. Why do people require access to computers? According to the author,
all of society is caught in an infinite loop. We have the same daily routines
that never lead anywhere, just a big cycle. The author describes the process
as &quot;consumption as therapy: leasing the Mercedes was the reward they
allowed themselves for having worked so hard for so many years... but the
Mercedes cost a little more than they could afford, so they worked even
harder... and on and on&quot; (17). The reason that we need computer technology
is to &quot;jolt society out of its infinite loop&quot; (18). That reason
was the motivation for all of the researchers to produce new and faster
computers, and to force the people to buy the newest, fastest, and the
best. The author complains that we all purchase computers that are far
faster and more powerful than we need, and the extra power is going to
waste.</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally or
some more than others? One of the major premises of the book is that only
some of us can even afford a computer, and therefore not everyone has access.
Bronson makes note of the fact that &quot;consumers would plop down five
grand for a computer they often only used to write letters&shy;because
it was a symbol. A symbol of power, of intelligence, of being up-to-date.
If computers were cool, then a bigger piece of hardware was the shortcut
to being really cool&quot; (39-40). Though we may not need the 'big iron,'
those of us who can afford it tend to buy computers that are far more powerful
then is adequate. Mr. Bronson makes the point several times that a $300
computer, or VWPC, would greatly benefit children in school. &quot;I think
it's important. If we had a computer for three hundred dollars, then maybe
a whole lot more people in this world would be using one&quot; (37). The
author later states that &quot;schoolkids can't afford a computer, few
people outside America can afford a computer&quot; (53). He goes on to
point out that &quot;most schools had a computer lab, where students would
go one hour a day to learn about computers. But they weren't really using
the computer as a tool to study their other subjects. Ideally, every desk
would have a VWPC on it&quot; (75). Mr. Bronson indicates that the problem
in schools is that although computers could greatly benefit education,
they are simply too expensive. Mr. Bronson says that the solution is to
build a cheaper computer. An affordable would reach a far greater number
of people and students, which is their ultimate mission. It could help
to improve schools as well as providing internet access at home. An inexpensive
computer allows everyone to gain in the advantage that the digital technology
presents.</P>

<P><B>Characters</B></P>

<P>Dr. Laura Aldridge-Laura is a psychology professor at Harvard University.
She is beautiful and has incredible genius, though it is largely unrecognized.
Her particular expertise is in cognition, or the study of thinking. She
is chosen because of her ability to discern true cognition from mere computer
programs.</P>

<P>Joseph Gray-Gray owns Gray corporation, who distributes televisions
and other communications equipment. Gray is the richest man in the world
because of his empire in television. He has a past as a super-genius who
never concentrated on finishing problems. He has developed the neural network
that is at the center of the book.</P>

<P>the computer-Though it has no name, the computer was certainly a main
character in the book. It can see and feel and think just like a human
because it was assembled with the human brain as a model. The computer
also catches a very human disease of emotions, and even human madness.</P>

<P><B>Synopsis</B></P>

<P>Dr. Laura Aldridge is called by Gray to go to his island for one week.
Upon arrival, she discovers that her duty is to diagnose Gray's sick computer.
The human-like super-computer controls so many functions of the outside
world that any mistakes could mean global catastrophe. Laura must treat
the computer of its mental illness before things get any worse.</P>

<P><B>Sub-question Analysis</B></P>

<P>1. What is digital technology? While the computer in the book is certainly
a computer, it is not digital. The main computer is an optical analog computer,
much more similar to the human brain. "It uses light instead of electricity
to process its basic logical operations and to store its memories" (74).
The optical analog computer represents a successful intelligence at developing
artificial intelligence, and may become the wave of our future.</P>

<P>2. What roles do computers play in our society? Computers play a major
role in the world of the novel. The main computer controls everything from
banking to pay-per-view television, and any breakdown of the computer could
literally mean global catastrophe. The new computerized television sets
also became very popular. "Everyone suddenly had to have one despite their
hefty price tag" (40). The computer was vitally important to the society.</P>

<P>3. How does the advance of digital technology pose a threat to our society?
As the technology advances and new computers are developed, the society
becomes increasingly reliant on the new technologies. This was the case
with the new optical computer in the book. The problem came when the computer
became ill, it could no longer fulfill its duties. This led to problems
in the society as the malfunctions started to pile up.</P>

<P>4. How has digital technology become more prevalent in our current society
than in the past? The book gives an excellent account of the basic development
of computers and what it means that this is the first sixth-generation
computer. It is different from all other computers because it emulates
the human brain, "the world's very first neurocomputer" (55). As the computers
moved along their evolutionary path, we always sought faster ones. This
led to the new technology and eventually it led all the way to the neurocomputer.</P>

<P>5. How do computers change and shape our society? Everyone in the society
of the book had to have one of the new computer televisions. Gray Corporation
was able to sell millions to people because the demand was so high. The
computers were an essential part of their society, much as the telephone
or television is for us. This power gave the computers large amounts of
power within the society.</P>

<P>6. In what ways might digital technologies affect our future? Though
the future effects are never clearly stated, it is easy to infer just what
the effects might be. As the technology becomes more human, it will make
more human mistakes. The question then becomes: if human madness can spread
to computers, can it spread back to humans?</P>

<P>7. Does the advance of computer technology affect us all equally or
some more that others? Again on this topic, the author does not make and
note. It can be inferred from the description of how everyone owns one
of the new computer televisions whether or not he can afford it. There
does not appear to be any difference in the access to technology, at least
not in this book.</P>

<P>8. Why does our society continue to enhance our existing digital technology?
The purpose of our digital technology is to enhance our world. By developing
new products, the Gray Corporation can help to make the world a better
place. It is for this reason , along with the profit, that they continue
to enhance the existing computer technology.</P>

<P>9. How are digital technologies both helpful and harmful? Due to the
advances in technology, the new computers certainly made life easier. Robotic
cars took people wherever they wanted to go without the need for driving.
Entire factories were run without any human intervention whatsoever. The
robots were capable of any feat and the central computer had the power
to do anything. This kind of automated world came at a price, however.
When the computer began to malfunction, the functions that people once
took advantage of no longer worked properly. In this way technology can
prove harmful to mankind. While the technology can be a great help, it
may also prove a hindrance</P>

<P>10. How have digital technologies changed our culture? The culture presented
in the book was not significantly different from our own. he characters
had far more technology available, but it did not necessarily affect the
way they went about their daily lives. The technology itself had very little
affect on their culture, only the customs of their island lifestyle proved
to be any different from our own routines.</P>
