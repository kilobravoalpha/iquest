<P><B>Lyrics:</B></P>

<P>Oh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya)<BR>
It's a wonder man can eat at all<BR>
When things are big that should be small<BR>
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us<BR>
And I'm giving all my love to this world<BR>
Only to be told<BR>
I can't see<BR>
I can't breathe<BR>
No more will we be<BR>
And nothing's going to change the way we live<BR>
Cos' we can always take but never give<BR>
And now that things are changing for the worse, <BR>
See, its a crazy world we're living in<BR>
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin<BR>
Is all we have to give these -</P>

<P>Futures made of virtual insanity now<BR>
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have<BR>
For useless, twisting, our new technology<BR>
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground</P>

<P>And I'm thinking what a mess we're in<BR>
Hard to know where to begin<BR>
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made<BR>
And now every mother, can choose the colour<BR>
Of her child<BR>
That's not nature's way<BR>
Well that's what they said yesterday<BR>
There's nothing left to do but pray<BR>
I think it's time I found a new religion<BR>
Waoh - it's so insane<BR>
To synthesize another strain<BR>
There's something in these<BR>
Futures that we have to be told.</P>

<P>Futures made of virtual insanity - now<BR>
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have<BR>
For useless, twisting, our new technology<BR>
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground</P>

<P>Now there is no sound If we all live underground<BR>
And now it's virtual insanity<BR>
Forget your virtual reality<BR>
Oh, there's nothing so bad.<BR>
I know yeah</P>

<P>Of this virtual insanity, we're livin in.<BR>
Has got to change, yeah<BR>
Things, will never be the same.<BR>
And I can't go on<BR>
While we're livin' in oh, oh virtual insanity<BR>
Oh, this world, has got to change<BR>
Cos I just, I just can't keep going on, it was virtual.<BR>
Virtual insanity that we're livin' in, that we're livin' in<BR>
That virtual insanity is what it is</P>

<P>Futures made of virtual insanity - now<BR>
Always seem to, be govern'd by this love we have<BR>
For useless, twisting, our new technology<BR>
Oh, now there is no sound - for we all live underground</P>

<P>Living - Virtual Insanity<BR>
Living - Virtual Insanity<BR>
Living - Virtual Insanity<BR>
Living - Virtual Insanity</P>

<P>Virtual Insanity is what we're living in</P>
