<H2>Career Mentorship</H2>

<P><B>400 Points</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December of last year and January of this year I completed an 18-hour
mentorship with Doug Huber, the Vice President of Engineering at Indiana
Automation, Inc. While I was with him, we visited many different factories
and plants that his company had helped to automate. I was allowed to experiment
with the software that he uses on a daily basis, as well as work in the
shop and even do some simple wiring. I learned a great deal about my prospective
field, Electrical Engineering. I was able to ask Doug and several of his
associates about fields of specialization, and I gave myself a clearer
picture of what I need to study in college. I also learned that Engineering
is the right career for me, which I can only do through personal experience.
I liked the hands-on aspect of that line of work. I thoroughly enjoyed
my mentorship experience, and I highly recommend it to any other interested
students. Other than having fun and meeting new people, it is an excellent
way to learn if a certain career is right for you. It also gives you a
contact in your field of expertise, someone you can count on later if you
have any questions.</P>

<H2>Internet Website</H2>

<P><B>200 Points</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My internet website, at the address &quot;http://members.iquest.net/~browns/tech.html&quot;
will be online as of Monday, May 11. It will contain an overview of my
problem and solution, interesting facts involved with my topic, and links
to other relevant sites. Designing such a site can be time consuming and
complicated, but it is also fun and may yield great results. This page
gives me the best opportunity to have my work seem by the public, literally
anyone in the world in this case.</P>

<H2>Class Presentation</H2>

<P><B>25 Points</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My presentation to the class on Wednesday, May 5 gives me another opportunity
to share my results and spread the word about what I have found. I plan
to do a PowerPoint presentation with some visual aids to keep interest
on my topic. I would also like to perform a demonstration of what knowledge
of technology can do for a person. Hopefully this presentation will be
fun to do and enjoyable for the class.</P>
