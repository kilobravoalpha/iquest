<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year at this time the snows began to fall. It was something that
they had grown to live with in Apple Valley, Minnesota. As Mark Wilberg
sat in his bedroom and looked contemplatively out the window, he couldn't
help but wonder if this year would be like all of the others.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark had
been born and raised in Apple Valley, a fairly affluent suburb of Minneapolis.
While he never considered himself to be rich, Mark's parents were usually
able to get him whatever he wanted. He attended Adams High School and couldn't
wait to go off to college next year. When he wasn't at home or school,
he could almost always be found at his best friend Josh's house. The two
shared an intense interest in information appliances, what we would have
called computers.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day the two found themselves in the middle of a particularly
boring lecture in their Modern History class. The teacher was talking about
the informational revolution of the first decade of the still new millennia.
The idea seemed about as removed to them as the industrial revolution,
and the whole class seemed to be somewhere between absent-minded daydreaming
and REM sleep. After some twenty years of teaching their instructor expected
this reaction, and so he decided to teach his class a lesson.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Imagine
yourself without all of the technology that you take for granted," Mr.
Grant began. "Without your netphones and pocketnets, your high definition
televisions, your digital walkmans, life would not be the same."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We've
lived thousands and even millions of years without this stuff," Mark interjected.
"I don't see what the big deal is. Just because we have this technology,
it doesn't change us as people."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I'll let you find that out for
yourself," Mr. Grant said. "Here is your assignment. For the next week
you can't use any of our new digital machines. That includes information
appliances, televisions, the Internet, and almost anything with an on switch."</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mike and Josh were discussing the assignment at lunch that day.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I still
don't think it's a big deal," Mark started. "I mean, It's fun to watch
TV and use the 'net and all, but how hard can it be to go without it?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I don't know, Mark," Josh replied. "I'm used to being able to use it.
I think it could be pretty hard to go without it."
</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark made his first
discovery when he went home that afternoon. He sat down, following his
daily routine, with a bag of microwaved popcorn to watch TV. As he reached
for the remote, he remembered the assignment. 'No problem,' he thought.
'I'll just give Josh a call, he'll find something to do.' But the phone
was off limits, too. Mark hopped onto his long-forgotten bicycle and pedaled
his way over to Josh's house.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally the two would play a virtual game
on Josh's system, but now that activity was off-limits too. The two finally
settled on an old board game they found in the basement, though this seemed
quite boring in comparison with their usual activity on the virtual game
system.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark ran into many other problems later that week. He had to drag
an old typewriter out of the attic to finish an English report, which he
received a poor grade on due to the lack of a built-in spelling and grammar
checker. He had to research Saturn for his science class, but because his
webphone was off-limits he had to resort to using an old book at the library.
Worst of all, Mark had to clean up after himself because the automaid was
of no use.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One week after the assignment had been given. Mark wanted badly
to use a digital machine again. Even if it was just the webphone, he couldn't
wait until he would be allowed access again. Once class started, Mr. Grant
asked his students how they had fared.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I guess you were right, Mr. Grant,"
Mark admitted. "It was very hard to do without the technology of the Information
Age. But I still don't see how any of this is relevant. I mean, now that
we do have the technology, why does it matter how different it might be
to live without it?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's exactly my point, Mark," Mr. Grant said excitedly.
"Life was very different without all of the technology that you take for
granted. Now, imagine that you had never even been exposed to the technology
in the first place. No webphones, no virtual video games, not even a word
processor. Did any of you find it harder to do your school work this week?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yea," Mark responded for the class. "I guess it was a little harder without
my word processor for English and the Internet for Science. But what's
your point?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm getting there, just wait," Mr. Grant answered. "You found
it harder to do the work without the aid of technology. What about those
who don't have access to the technology? Do you think that puts them at
a disadvantage?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I see your point now," Mark replied. "There are
people who don't have information appliances, and I suppose that puts them
at a disadvantage. But the problem is so big! What could we possibly do
to fix the problem?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment of thought, Mr. Grant answered, "that's
up to you." </P>
