<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, computers are everywhere. Everything from your
car to your wristwatch probably contains some sort of computer chip. At
the heart of the computer is its digital logic. Digital technology, which
includes the computer, is a very broad term and can describe a whole range
of digital objects. The question then becomes: What is digital technology?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Homo erectus discovered, used, and improved
upon numerous aspects of culture that are basic to present day life. These
accomplishments occur extremely slowly, however, taking place over thousands
of years. When Homo sapiens, the modern human species, appeared, cultural
changes began occurring with much greater frequency and took on greater
sophistication&quot; (Farah 26). These changes are what we call technology.
First came fire, then the plow, and now we have the computer. Each of these
presents monumental changes to our society and the way we live.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology can be simply defined as the ability to
use tools to improve the conditions of mankind. JoAnne Woodstock defines
technology as &quot;the application of science and engineering to the development
of machines and procedures in order to enhance or improve human conditions,
or at least human efficiency in some respect&quot; (274). Computers and
other digital appliances provide examples of this definition because they
use science to advance the human race in many ways. The World Book Dictionary
defines technology as &quot;the body of tools, machines, materials, techniques,
and processes used to produce goods and services and satisfy human needs&quot;
(Barnhart 672). This definition also describes the computer very well.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental new technology that made the computer
possible was the advent of digital logic, which describes the way that
a computer 'thinks.' The author of Cyberspeak defines the term digital
as &quot;a signal which consists of a series of 'ons' and 'offs' &Ntilde;
any signal which passes through a computer&quot; (Ihnatko 54). A bit, as
defined by Nicholas Negroponte, Media Director at MIT, is &quot;a state
of being: on or off, true or false, up or down, black or white. For practical
purposes we consider a bit to be a 1 or a 0&quot; (14). A digital appliance
consists of many states of either on or off. These are represented with
a 1 for on and a 0 for off. For example, imagine a simple light switch.
When it is turned on, the circuit is in a 1 state, and when it is turned
off, it is in a 0 state. Combining several of these bits allows a computer
to create large numbers, referred to as bytes. Each of these bytes represents
a quantity, value, instruction, color, or anything else that can be quantified.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital appliances are unique because they only have
certain states of on or off, with no in-between. &quot;Digital computers
- like all digital devices - work with digits rather than with continuously
variable quantities like lengths or voltages&quot; (New 354). In order
to understand this concept, it is important to know the opposite of digital,
or analog. &quot;The principle feature of analog representations is that
they are continuous. In contrast, digital representations consist of values
measured at discreet intervals&quot; (Digital 3). To explain this difference
it is helpful to think of a digital clock and a clock with hands, or analog
clock. The digital clock has certain states where either one number or
the other is on, no in-between. The analog clock, on the other hand, is
continuous and has no gaps between states, or times. Whereas the analog
clock has an infinite number of points on its scale, the digital clock
is limited to the numbers it can display, so it has a finite number of
possible points.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of being a 1 or a 0 is called binary logic.
The Microsoft Computer Dictionary describes the importance of binary logic
to computers by saying &quot;because these digits can be used to represent
two states, on and off or true and false, which in turn can be easily represented
by two voltage levels in an electronic device, the binary number system
is at the heart of digital computing&quot; (Woodstock 35). Digital appliances
use the binary system to assign mathematical values to different voltage
levels within the circuitry, and vice-versa, which is how they derive their
ability to calculate. This power to calculate is what makes the computer
useful to us.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the simplest roots of 1's and 0's, computers
give us the power to do unimaginable things. Computers have already changed
the way we do academic research, to the point that it would be unimaginable
to use the old card catalog. Slide rules have been confined to attics and
antique stores, as they have been replaced with the calculator. From ATMs
to automobiles, computers are everywhere, making our lives easier. This
power, if granted to everyone, promises to change our entire culture and
move us onto the next level of civilization.</P>
