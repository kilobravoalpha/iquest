<H1>Our Future, Part II</H1>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statistics are amazing. Whites are three times
as likely as blacks to have a computer in the home (Hancock 50). Those
who make more than $75,000 per year are nearly five times as likely to
have a computer than those who earn less than $20,000 (Hancock 50). Computer
skills can mean a 15% difference in pay (Ratan 25). But the numbers never
hit home unless the problem can be seen through the eyes of a sufferer.
A sufferer like Timika Mitchell.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timika grew up in the Salvation Army shelter in Austin,
Texas. She used to be a homeless, unmarried mother of two children without
much hope for the future. She now works for Time Warner and lives in her
own apartment in Austin. How did she pull off such a drastic change? She
did it by learning to use the computer (Chapman 48).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Timika was living in the Salvation Army shelter,
she developed her first web page. Timika is a member of <A HREF="http://www.austinfree.net/">Austin
Free-Net</A>, an organization that has set up and maintains public computer
terminals throughout Austin. Teachers and volunteers help the disadvantaged
to use the computers. The only money for the Austin Free-Net, and more
than 200 similar community networks around the country, comes from small
funds from local governments and occasional grants from the national government.
These networks serve to introduce people to computers and show them that
high-tech doesn't mean scarry (Chapman 48-49).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from helping members of the community to become
acquainted with technology, the network has provided many other benefits.
Seniors have been able to use the network to keep in touch with each other.
Churches have joined in and are helping to teach web-page design. Single
mothers can take night classes to earn high school diplomas while learning
how to use the computer. Jay de la Garza helps to explain the benefits.
&quot;My parents wouldn't let me go out at night because it's too dangerous
where we live... but they let me go to Free-Net sites to do what I love
the most, which is to help teach people the internet&quot; (Chapman 50).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that there are alternatives to provide computer
access to everyone. Computer access has many positive benefits, giving
new employment to those who had no job and inspiring those who had no hope.
As demonstrated by the Austin Free-Net, the cost of public computing centers
is extremely low, especially in comparison to the benefits received. The
real question is: How can we afford not to?</P>
