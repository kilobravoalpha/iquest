<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computers are an extremely powerful tool, but they
can also come with a high price tag, which presents a problem for those
who would like to use a computer but can not afford the heavy price tag.
The ideal solution would allow access to computers for all members of the
community without any of the cost associated with computers. One way to
accomplish this goal is to have communities establish public computing
centers to allow access to all members of our society. This solution would
permit access to and education for technology on a free basis to help reach
as much of the community as possible.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nationwide initiative to allow public access to
computers will be called <I>CAREER</I>, or <I>Computer Access Resulting
in Equal Employment Rights</I>. The local plan names may vary based on
location, but they should capture a local community spirit as well as a
computer experience. For example, a local center in Zionsville may be named
<I>ZionNet</I> or <I>Zionsville Community Computer Center</I>.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizer in charge of setting up and running
the center will be a local organizer. This person will be selected by the
local government from among a pool of applicants. The position will be
full time with a minimum starting salary of $25,000 per year. The person
will be an employee of the government, and therefore will get the same
benefits as other local government employees. The applicant need only have
a fair amount of technical experience on computers and enough organizational
skills to be capable of running such a site. The organizer's first duty
will be to select a site for the computer center. Once an appropriate site
has been found, this person is in charge of establishing a center and selecting
a part-time staff to help. When the center nears it's opening date, the
coordinator will distribute announcements in the schools and communities
to publicize the availability of the computers. This person will be in
charge of day-to-day operations once the center is running.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task of selecting a site is the first responsibility
of the organizer. The most appropriate location would be in a local school,
because schools often have large computer labs that have already been paid
for by the government. In 1998, an estimated 89% of schools have internet
access and the computers required to use it, and the number will increase
to 95% by the year 2000 (Tapscott 308). If an appropriate site can not
be found at a local school, the library would be an appropriate alternative.
Either site already has computers paid for by the government, which means
little or no equipment cost for the program.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each site would initially be open from 4:00 PM to
9:00 PM on Monday through Friday and from Noon until 8:00 PM on Saturdays
and Sundays, though these hours may vary as needed. On the weekdays the
center is open it will be staffed by the coordinator and one part-time
staff member, who will earn an hourly wage of $7.00. On the weekends it
will be run by two part-time employees, each making $7.00 per hour. The
part-time person must have computer experience and must be able to communicate
well with others. High school students looking for part-time work would
be acceptable. The total for labor, including a full-time position and
part-time labor, comes to $45,748 per year, or slightly more than $45,000
per year. Because expenses such as facilities operating cost and computer
maintenance would be fairly small, these could be absorbed by the school
or library. The total cost of the project, establishing one site for a
small population of about 5,000 to 10,000 people, would be approximately
$40,000. This total would be split evenly between the local and state governments,
with each side paying $20,000 towards the center.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step is to find funding for the project
on both state and local levels. Each will be given four months to find
funding, beginning in May of 1998. Funding should be available by September,
at which point the local government will select a local coordinator. This
should take about two months with the completion set for November. The
coordinator will then select a site for the center and a part-time staff
to work in the site. This process will take about two months, after which
the site will open its doors. The opening date will then be January 1999.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each computing center will offer two introductory
computing classes, one on a weekday evening, and one on the weekend. These
classes will give basic orientation skills with a computer and give basic
training in how to use an operating system and a word processor. These
classes will be two hours in length and will last for one month, and will
be taught by one of the two employees who are always on duty. A second
class of the same length and times will offer orientation toward the internet
and e-mail. Orientation for other software will occur in one hour sessions
throughout the week.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, the heavy cost associated with computers
does not allow access to disadvantaged people who cannot afford one. The
computing center plan solves this problem by allowing access to computers
while foregoing the high cost, effectively presenting an equalizer to help
the disadvantaged to keep up with those who own computers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The setup for this plan is fairly simple. Once proper
funding is obtained, the only remaining obstacle is to find an appropriate
site. Using a public school computer lab is not unreasonable and provides
a nearly ideal alternative to owning a computer. Because the program encourages
computer literacy at no cost, it would be able to draw in people. Encouraging
computer literacy also promotes worker productivity, which would help the
program to pay for itself in the long run. Because the project requires
a relatively small amount of funding, this step should not present a challenge.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plan allows anyone who wants access to a computer
to have a computer and a tutor at their disposal at no cost. Providing
computer skills to the community gives them an advantage in the job market,
which often requires at least some knowledge of computers for almost any
job. Providing access to internet and e-mail allows people to communicate
around the world as well as performing research. This plan also provides
a simple and cost-effective solution, which is desirable in every case.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplicity of this program makes it practical.
The idea of providing a relatively small number of computers to a group
makes much more sense than providing each person, which has been proposed
in the past. Fewer computers means less expense, less maintenance, and
a better use of resources. Putting a computing center in a public place
would make access convenient to everyone. This solution provides the most
practical alternative to solving the problem of unequal access to computers.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may argue that people would not come to
such a computer center. This can be proven false, however, by looking at
examples in other areas. A similar plan was executed in East Palo Alto,
in which a community center was established to give the community free
access to computers and to the internet. Dominic Bannister, a 15 year old
boy who often visits the center, described the advantages. &quot;I think
they should have a place like Plugged-In in every community, especially
in troubled neighborhoods. Here, this place has helped the community a
lot and it's a great place to be at&quot; (Tapscott 269). The center was
a huge success and it was even able to make a lasting positive impression
on the community.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solving the problem of how to increase adult computer
literacy would yield enormous benefits. Establishing a site such as described
above allows for and encourages computer literacy in the adult population
of a community. These skills increase productivity and may allow for new
employment opportunity. The cost for the community relative to the benefits
and opportunities is very small, making this plan the most economical and
practical solution of all.</P>
